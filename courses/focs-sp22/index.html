      <h1>Foundations of Computer Science (Spring 2022)</h1>
    
      <p>This course explores the notion of computation. We're going to
        develop formal tools for defining what we mean by computation
        through various models, including automata and the lambda
        calculus. We will examine how some of these alternative models
        of computations correspond to different programming paradigms.

        <h2>Course Information</h2>

        <ul class="plain">
          <li><b>Course number:</b> ENGR 3520</li>

          <li><b>Prerequisites:</b> Prior experience programming is required (Software Design or something equivalent) since I will not teach programming. Discrete Mathematics is no longer a formal prerequisite for FoCS. </li>

          <li><b>Location and Time:</b>
            AC 328 / Mon 4-7pm
          </li>

          <li><b>Instructor:</b> <a href="https://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (&#x72;&#x69;&#x63;&#x63;&#x61;&#x72;&#x64;&#x6F;&#x2E;&#x70;&#x75;&#x63;&#x65;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x61;&#x40;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#x69;&#x6E;&#x2E;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;)</li>

          <li><b>Office hours:</b> MH 353 / Tue 5-6pm, or by request (over Zoom)
          </li>

          <li><b>Textbook:</b> There is no required textbook for the course. We will be working off
            notes and online references. In particular, I will share the first two chapters of Hubie
            Chen's upcoming <i>Computability and Complexity</i>, courtesy of MIT Press. This will be
            the source of our readings.

          </li>

          <li><b>Recommended Books:</b> There are several excellent books covering the first part of
            the course (aka, Theory of Computation), but they are a bit expensive considering that
            we will be covering only a small part of their content. If you need extra assistance,
            though, any of these books would be useful, and they are on reserve in the Olin library:
            
            <ul>
              <li>Sisper, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/1133187811">Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a></i></li>
	      <li>Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Theory-Languages-Computation/dp/0321455363">Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation</a></i></li>
            </ul>
            
            An inexpensive and reasonable book is the following, although it uses Ruby instead of OCaml:
            <ul>
	      <li>Stuart, <i><a href="http://computationbook.com">Understanding Computation</a></i></li>
            </ul>
            It very much follows the spirit of this iteration of FoCS. Again, not required. But if you enjoy the course, you may enjoy the book.
            
          </li>

          
          <li><b>Programming:</b> All programming in this course will be done using the programming
            language <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. The OCaml compiler can be downloaded
            from the web site, and supports installations on most common systems. You can find the installation instructions <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/up_and_running.html">here</a>. (You only need to install up to and including <b>The OCaml top level</b>. We are not going to use the <b>Dune</b> build system.)

            Here are a couple of reasonable books on OCaml that you might want to get your hands on
            if you prefer learning your programming language from a book instead of the web:
            
            <ul>
              <li>Hickey, <i><a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf">Introduction
	            to Objective Caml</a></i> (PDF)</li>
              <li>Downey, Monje, <i><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkocaml/">Think
	            OCaml</a></i></li>
	      <li>Minsky, Madhavapeddy, Hickey, <i><a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">Real World
	            OCaml</a></i></li>
            </ul>

            Some online resources:
            <ul>
              
	      <li>The OCaml website has a few
	      good <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/">tutorials</a>. At the very least,
	      read
	      through <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/a_first_hour_with_ocaml.html">A
	      First Hour with OCaml</a> which gives you the basics of interacting with OCaml.</li>
              
	      <li>The <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/index.html">official OCaml
	          manual</a></li>
              
	      <li>Some information on
	        the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/toplevel.html#sec256">commands
	        you can use in the OCaml shell</a>, which can be useful</li>
              
	      <li>There are no official IDEs for OCaml, but many people swear
	        by <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop"><i>utop</i></a>, which is an OCaml shell
	        replacement. There's also
	        <a href="http://camelia.sourceforge.net/"><i>Camelia</i></a>,
	        but I've never used it. There is
	        an <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/">Eclipse
	          plug-in</a> for OCaml.
	      </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li><b>Grading:</b> The final grade is based on weekly homework (80%) and in-classes
            quizzes (20%). All work will be done individually. Late homeworks will be penalized (10%
            per 24 hours) and no homework will be accepted after its solution has been discussed in
            class. <b>Please do not post your homework code on a publicly available repository like
            GitHub.</b> I hate to do this kind of policing, but we've had some issues in the past,
            and I'd like to avoid a repeat if possible. Note that if we move to a fully on-line
            setting this semester, the grading scheme will move to a 100% weekly homeworks scheme.

            <p>A reasonably easy to follow proof that it's impossible to <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/square_circle/">square the circle</a> using only straight edge and compass. The argument basically amounts to showing that &pi; is transcendental, that is, is not the root of any polynomial equation.</p>

            <p>Some interesting history about
              the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Quadratic_etc_equations.html">quadratic,
                cubic, and quartic equations</a>, including the <i>solve-offs</i> that mathematicians held in the 1500s. They are rather naturally bound to the discovery of complex numbers. Some details on <a href="http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/factor/fac11/fac11.html">how to solve a cubic equation</a>, if you're curious.</p>
	    
	    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems">Hilbert's

	    <p>I mentioned the fact that set comprehension requires some restrictions on the properties allowed for constructing sets. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/">Russell's Paradox</a> is why we need such restrictions.</p>
	    <p>Union, intersection, and complementation of sets can be described using set comprehensions that uses conjunction, disjunction, and negation, respectively. This close connection between set operations and logic is a reflection of the fact that sets form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean algebra</a>.</p>

            <p>One reason we study nondeterministic forms of finite
              automata is that they can be easier to describe than
              deterministic finite automata. More specifically, there
              exists languages that can be accepted by
              nondeterministic finite automata with N states whose
              smallest deterministic finite automata that accept those
              same languages have at least 2<sup>N</sup> states. One
              example is the language over {<tt>a</tt>,<tt>b</tt>}
              consisting of all strings whose Nth from last symbol
              is <tt>a</tt>. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NFA_with_exponential_blown-up_DFA.gif">Here

              <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">Point-free</a> style is a fascinating rabbit hole to dive into. It is a way to program functions without specifying the arguments on which they operate, but simply composing together functions using higher-order functions, assuming a bank of primitive functions to work from. It is mostly useful to allow equational reasoning about programs (a form of verification). Here's some examples written in point-free style:</p>

              <pre>
    let add x y = x + y
    let mult x y = x * y
    
    let dup f x = f x x

            <p>A <a href="./tm-anbn.png">diagram</a> of the Turing machine I showed in class to accept the langage {<tt>a</tt><sup>n</sup><tt>b</tt><sup>n</sup> | n &ge; 0}. If you want to practice, you can try to modify the machine to accept the languages {<tt>a</tt><sup>m</sup><tt>b</tt><sup>n</sup> | n &ge; m &ge; 0} and {<tt>a</tt><sup>n</sup><tt>b</tt><sup>n</sup><tt>c</tt><sup>n</sup> | n &ge; 0}.</p>

	      Turing that describes his machines. (Though it's not the most accessible
	      description.)</p>
	    
	    <p>There are machines that are more expressive than finite
	      automata (i.e. accept non-regular languages) but less
	      expressive than Turing machines. One example
	      is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton">pushdown
	        automata</a>, which are finite automata equipped with a
	      stack. They accept a class of languages that is larger
	      (and includes) regular languages, but smaller than what is
	      accepted by Turing machines.</p>

	    <p>It is possible to create a variant of finite auomata that do not use a tape but that
	    can count. The resulting model is called
	    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_automaton">counter automata</a>. When
	    equipped with a single counter, it can accept languages such as
	    {<tt>a</tt><sup>n</sup><tt>b</tt><sup>n</sup> | n &ge; 0}, but cannot accept all
	    computable languages. When equipped with two counters, the resulting machines can accept
	    all computable languages, and are equivalent to Turing machines.</p>

            <p>Some notes on <a href="noncomputable.pdf">non-computable languages</a>. These use a slightly different definition of Turing machines that have a <i>leftmost marker</i> on the tape to prevent the tape pointer moving past the left of the tape. This variant doesn't change Turing machines in the least.</p>

            <p>I made remarks in class about the fact that the non-computability (also known as <i>undecidability</i>) of the halting problem for Turing machines impacts, via the Church-Turing thesis, any kind of reasoning that we wish to make about programs in modern programming languages. Matthew Might has an accessible account that <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/intro-static-analysis/">describes how the non-computability of the halting problem impacts static analysis of programs</a>.

            <p>R&eacute;v&eacute;sz's book <a href="https://store.doverpublications.com/0486169375.html">Introduction to Formal Languages</a> is nice little book that covers everything we've done until now (finite automata, Turing machines, computability), but starting from the perspective of grammars.

	    <p>Grammars are used in linguistics (introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures">Chomsky to study the structure of natural languages</a>) and in computer science to implement parsers, that is, turning a string of symbols into a structured artifact like an Abstract Syntax Tree to represent a program in a form that it more amenable to execution and/or compilation. <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/sc1112/intro-parsing.pdf">Here's

	    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton">Pushdown automata</a> are machine models that exactly capture context-free languages:

	    <p>The fact that the order in which you perform simplifications in the lambda calculus doesn't matter (aside from the possibility of never reaching a normal form) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Rosser_theorem">Church-Rosser property</a>.</p>
	    
	    <p>Some additional introductory references on the lambda calculus: <a href="http://palmstroem.blogspot.com/2012/05/lambda-calculus-for-absolute-dummies.html">The Lambda Calculus for Absolute Dummies (Like Myself)</a> and Rojas's <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf">A Tutorial Introduction to the Lambda Calculus</a>. Note that these references use the standard presentation of the calculus, with &lambda;x.M instead of &lt;x &rarr; M&gt;. These also cover some of the material I will talk about next time.</p>

            <p>Not strictly about the lambda calculus, but many of the ideas from the lambda calculus are embodied in the Lisp programming language, and I would get my CS membership card revoked if I didn't point you to <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, which uses a Lisp-like language to explore all sorts of ideas for how to approach the art of programming.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a> is a functional programming language with lazy evaluation, in which lists can be infinite, and therefore can be used to represent infinite streams of values. The most interesting language coming out of the Haskell tradition is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)">Agda</a>, which pushes a static type system to its limits, turning type checking into theorem proving. It's definitely worth digging into if you have the time.</p>
            
            <p>The <a href="./streams.hs">sample Haskell code</a> I used in class to illustrate the examples we did using dataflow networks. Here's an <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/TDA452/lectures/Laziness.html">alternative presentation</a> of those ideas.</p>

            <p>The language MiniOCaml I described in class to illustrate ideas from type systems roughly corresponds to the one called T<sub>simp</sub> described in these <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs421/sp2010/lectures/lecture21.pdf">slides</a> with the addition of Boolean types, conditionals, and local bindings (let). The slides describe what a "proof system" is a bit more. They also talk about operational semantics, which is what would let you say, for instance, that if an expression type checks, then evaluating the expression yields a value of the correct type.</p>
            
            <p>Wikipedia entry on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus">simply-typed lambda calculus</a>, which the theory underlying what I described in class. (We covered only the first two sections, if that, but we added primitive integer and Boolean types.). The page includes a link to Church's original paper <i><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/28bf/123690205ae5bbd9f8c84b1330025e8476e4.pdf">A Formulation of the Simple Theory of Types</a></i>. The "simple theory of types" is a simplification of the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/">theory that Russell devised</a> to try to get around the paradoxes that he discovered.

            <p>I alluded to a relationship between the typing rules for MiniOCaml and a form of propositional logic called <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intuitionistic/">intuitionistic propositional logic</a>. That relationship is known as the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and is beautifully laid out in <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf">Philip Wadler's <i>Propositions as Types</i></a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">Type inference</a> is the process of having the compiler infer the types of expressions automatically, before or while doing type checking. OCaml uses a form of the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm linked to from the page above.</p>

            <p>If you like this topic, you can dig into <a href="https://profs.sci.univr.it/~merro/files/harper.pdf">Bob Harper's <i>Practical Foundations for Programming Languages</i></a> which covers type systems and <i>so</i> much more.</p>

            <p>I mentioned Rust as a language whose type system goes beyond enforcing the kind of safety that OCaml (Java, Scala, etc) type systems enforce — it can be used to enforce <a href="https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/ownership.html">memory ownership</a>.</p>
