    <p>This course explores the notion of computation. We're going to
      develop formal tools for defining what we mean by computation
      through various models, including automata and the lambda
      calculus. We will examine how some of these alternative models
      of computations correspond to different programming paradigms.

	    I added the notes on recursion and combinatory logic to the lambda calculus notes below. I also got inspired last night and implemented the SKI transformation rules I described you in class. It was fun, for some idiosyncratic definition of fun. (It uses techniques we haven't seen yet, of the kind I already used in the implementation of the lambda calculus.) If you want to try it, <a href="./ski.ml">here is the code for function <tt>convert_ski</tt></a>. You can add it at the end of file <tt>homework7.ml</tt> and use it from there, since it uses the lambda calculus implementation from that homework.

            This concerns Homework 4: it's pretty easy in our implementation of TMs to encode information in the name of the states of the TM in such a way that the resulting Turing machine has infinitely many states. There's nothing in the code that forces the transition function to only refer to finitely many states. For instance, you could define the following transition function <tt>fun (q, a) -> (q ^ "x", a, 1))</tt> which says that state "hello" transitions to state "hellox" and then to state "hellox" and then to state "helloxx", etc, etc. Of course, the set of states reachable by the transition of the TM must all be listed in field states of the TM, but that's not checked anywhere unless you add that check yourself to your <tt>run</tt> fuction.
          </p>
          <p>Accordingly, I've create a small function <tt>validateStates</tt> function available <a href="validate-states.ml">here</a> that traverses the transition graph of a TM and checks that every state you can reach from the start state is listed in the <tt>states</tt> field of the TM, and fails on the first state it encounters that isn't listed in the states list.
          </p>

          <p>
            Feel free to add this to your file <tt>homework4.ml</tt> (it should go after the type definition for <tt>'a tm</tt>) and use it to check your TMs. I will be running a version of this validation on my end during testing to make sure you haven't defined TMs with infinite states.

              <li>If you make changes to your <tt>homework1.ml</tt> file, you can always reload it with <tt>#use "homework1.ml";;</tt></li>

      <h3>Course Information</h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Discrete Mathematics is no longer a formal prerequisite for FoCS. Prior experience programming will be helpful, since I will not teach programming, as will facility with basic set-theoretic concepts.</p>

      <p><b>Instructor:</b> <a href="http://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (&#x72;&#x69;&#x63;&#x63;&#x61;&#x72;&#x64;&#x6F;&#x2E;&#x70;&#x75;&#x63;&#x65;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x61;&#x40;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#x69;&#x6E;&#x2E;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;)</p>

      <p><b>Office hours:</b> Tue 14:00-15:20 / MH 353. (Also available online &mdash; send email to coordinate.)</p>

      <p><b>Textbooks:</b> There is no required textbook for the course. We will be working off notes and online references.</p>

      <p>
	There are several excellent books on Theory of Computation
      (the first part of the course), but they are a bit expensive considering that we will 
	be covering only a small part of their content. If you need extra assistance, though, any of these books would be useful:
      <ul>
	<li>Sisper, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/1133187811">Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a></i></li>
	<li>Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Theory-Languages-Computation/dp/0321455363">Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation</a></i></li>
      </ul>
      The library has those two books on reserve. Feel free to go and consult them.
      </p>

      <p>
      An inexpensive and reasonable book is the following, although it uses Ruby instead of OCaml:
      <ul>
	<li>Stuart, <i><a href="http://computationbook.com">Understanding Computation</a></i></li>
      </ul>
      It very much follows the spirit of this iteration of FoCS.
      </p>
    
      <p><b>Programming:</b> All programming in this course will be done
      using the programming
      language <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. The OCaml
      interpreter can be downloaded from the web site, and
	supports installations on most common systems. Here are a couple of reasonable books on OCaml that you might
      want to get your hands on if you prefer learning your
      programming language from a book instead of the web:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Hickey, <i><a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf">Introduction
	      to Objective Caml</a></i> (PDF)</li>
	<li>Downey, Monje, <i><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkocaml/">Think
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
	<li>Minsky, Madhavapeddy, Hickey, <i><a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">Real World
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some online resources:</p>
      <ul>

	<li><a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/basics.html">OCaml: The Basics</a> is a very small tutorial giving you the basics of interacting with OCaml.</li>

	<li>Some information on
	  the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/toplevel.html#sec256">commands
	    you can use in the OCaml shell</a>, which can be
	  useful</li>

	<li>The <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/index.html">official
	    OCaml manual</a></li>

	<li>There are no official IDEs for OCaml, but many
	  people swear
	  by <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop"><i>utop</i></a>,
	  which is an OCaml shell replacement. There's also
	  <a href="http://camelia.sourceforge.net/"><i>Camelia</i></a>,
	  but I've never used it. There is
	  an <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/">Eclipse
	    plug-in</a> for OCaml.
	</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><b>Grading:</b> The final grade is based on weekly homework
      (70%) and two exams (15% each).  All work will be done
      individually. Late homeworks will be penalized (10% per 24
      hours) and no homework will be accepted after its solution has
      been discussed in class.

      <b>Please do not post your code on a public available repository
	like GitHub.</b> I hate to do this kind of policing, but we've had
	some issues in the past, and I'd like to avoid a repeat if
	possible.

      <p><b>Ninjas:</b> We have two ninjas for the class: Evan Lloyd New-Schmidt and Louise Nielsen
      (<tt>evan.new-schmidt</tt> and <tt>Louise.Nielsen</tt> at  the fairly standard
        <tt>students</tt>.<tt>olin</tt>.<tt>edu</tt>). Office hours are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Evan: Sunday 6-8</li>
          <li>Louise: Monday 6-8</li>
        </ul>
      You can also reach out to them directly to schedule something out-of-band. They're very good people.
      </p>

      <p>I will expect all of us to follow the <a href="http://www.olin.edu/academic-life/student-affairs-resources/student-life/honor-code/">Olin Honor Code</a>.</p>

	  <div class="lect">
	    <p><a href="notes/languages.pdf">Notes on formal languages</a>.</p>
	    <p>I mentioned the fact that set comprehension requires some restrictions on the properties allowed for constructing sets. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/">Russell's Paradox</a> is a clear indication of why we need such restrictions.</p>
	    <p>Union, intersection, and complementation of sets can be described using set comprehensions that uses conjunction, disjunction, and negation, respectively. This close connection between set operations and logic is a reflection of the fact that sets form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean algebra</a>.</p>
	    <p>Regular expressions are often used to search for patterns in text. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/3261/fall07/handout/egrep_mini-tutorial.htm">Here is an example of how they are used in egrep</a>. Note that the equivalence between regular expressions and regular languages only holds for <i>pure</i> regular expressions. Most regular expression packages used in practice extend regular expressions in ways that let you express non-regular languages.</p>
	    <p>If you define two regular expressions to be equal when they denote the same set of strings, then regular expressions obey the laws of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_algebra">Kleene algebras</a>.</p>

	<li><p><span class="hdr">Sep 17:</span><b>Finite automata</b></p>
	  <div class="lect">
	    <p><a href="notes/automata.pdf">Notes on finite automata</a>.</p>
	    <p>The notes include some supplementary material at the
	    end, fleshing out things that I think are pretty
	    interesting: (1) I show how the language accepted by a
	    finite automaton must be regular; (2) I point out how you
	    can use finite automata to show that the complement of a
	    regular language is regular; (3) I show how you can use
	    finite automata to argue that some languages are not
	    regular. I will talk about this last one next time. </p>
	    <p>I pointed out in class one reason we study
              nondeterministic forms of finite automata is that they can be easier
              to describe than deterministic finite automata. More specifically,
              there exists languages that can be accepted by nondeterministic finite
              automata with N states whose smallest deterministic finite automata
              that accept those same languages have at least 2<sup>N</sup>
              states. One example is the language over {<tt>a</tt>,<tt>b</tt>}
              consisting of all strings whose Nth from last symbol
              is <tt>a</tt>. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NFA_with_exponential_blown-up_DFA.gif">Here
                is an illustration</a> of the subset construction for that language,
              over alphabet {0,1}, and N=4.</p>

	    <p>There are machines that are more expressive than finite
	    automata (i.e. accept non-regular languages) but less
	    expressive than Turing machines. One example
	    is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton">pushdown
	    automata</a>, which are finite automata equipped with a
	    stack. They accept a class of languages that is larger
	    (and includes) regular languages, but smaller than what is
	      accepted by Turing machines.</p>

	    <p>It is conceivable to create finite auomata without memory, but that can count. The resulting model is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_automaton">counter automaton</a>. When equipped with a single counter, it can accept languages such as {<tt>a</tt><sup>n</sup><tt>b</tt><sup>n</sup> | n &ge; 0}, but cannot accept all computable languages. When equipped with two counters, the resulting machines can accept all computable languages, and are equivalent to Turing machines.</p>

	    <p>The <a href="combinators.ml">example of higher-order programming, currying, and "point-free" programming</a> that I showed in class at some point. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">Point-free</a> programming is a fascinating rabbit hole to dive into. It is mostly useful to allow equational reasoning about programs (a form of verification).</p>

	  <p>Grammars are used in linguistics (introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures">Chomsky to study the structure of natural languages</a>) and in computer science to implement parsers, that is, turning a string of symbols into a structured artifact like an Abstract Syntax Tree to represent a program in a form that it more amenable to execution and/or compilation. <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/sc1112/intro-parsing.pdf">Here's
	  a reasonable high-level presentation</a> of the basics of parsing, to give you a flavor.</p> 

	  <p>A beautiful application of grammars
	  is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems</a>,
	  a class of grammars that model the growth processes of plant
	    development.</p>

	  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton">Pushdown automata</a> are machine models that exactly capture context-free languages:
        a language A is context-free if and only if you can find a pushdown automaton that accepts A.</p>

          <div class="lect">
	    <p><a href="notes/lambda.pdf">Notes</a> from the lecture. These notes explicitly define a substitution function, something I left undefined in class.</p>
	    
	    <p>That the order in which you perform simplifications in the lambda calculus doesn't matter (aside from the possibility of never reaching a normal form) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Rosser_theorem">Church-Rosser property</a>.</p>
	    
	    <p>Some additional introductory references on the lambda calculus: <a href="http://palmstroem.blogspot.com/2012/05/lambda-calculus-for-absolute-dummies.html">The Lambda Calculus for Absolute Dummies (Like Myself)</a> and Rojas's <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf">A Tutorial Introduction to the Lambda Calculus</a>. Note that these references use the standard presentation of the calculus, with &lambda;x.M instead of &lt;x &rarr; M&gt;</p>

            <p>Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic">Combinatory Logic</a>.</p>
            <p>Not strictly about the lambda calculus, but many of the ideas from the lambda calculus are embodied in the Lisp programming language, and I would get my CS membership card revoked if I didn't point you to <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, which uses a Lisp-like language to explore all sorts of ideas for how to approach the art of programming.</p>

	    binary search trees I described in
	    class, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">AVL
	    trees</a>. The description of the rotations that restore
	    the balanced height property after an insertion is
	    reasonably clear there. There are basically four cases to
	      consider, depending on the local form of unbalance.</p>
	    <p>A <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html">cute visualization</a> of what happens when you insert
	    into an AVL tree. Try starting with the empty tree, and
	    inserting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... You'll see the tree
	      grow "to the right" and then rebalance itself repeatedly.</p>

	    <p>There are two main sources for the dataflow
	    computational model, neither of which is exactly what I
	    presented: Gilles Kahn's work
	    on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks">Kahn

	      architectures</a>.</p>

	    <p>The programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_(programming_language)">Lucid</a> embodies some of the ideas presented in class in an interesting way.</p>

            <p>Languages with lazy evaluation usually give an easy way to implement dataflow networks. <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2018/course/TDA452/lectures/Laziness.html">Here is a reasonable overview</a> in Haskell with examples that should be familiar.</p>
