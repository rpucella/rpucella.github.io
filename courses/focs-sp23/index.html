      <h1>Foundations of Computer Science (Spring 2023)</h1>
    
      <p>This course explores the notion of computation. We're going to
        develop formal tools for defining what we mean by computation
        through various models, including automata and the lambda
        calculus. We will examine how some of these alternative models
        of computations correspond to different programming paradigms.

        <h2>Course Information</h2>

        <ul class="plain">
          <li><b>Course number:</b> ENGR 3520</li>

          <li><b>Prerequisites:</b> Prior experience programming is required (Software Design or something equivalent) since I will not teach programming. Discrete Mathematics is no longer a formal prerequisite for FoCS. </li>

          <li><b>Location and Time:</b>
            MAC 126 / Mon 6-8:40pm
          </li>

          <li><b>Instructor:</b> <a href="https://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (&#x72;&#x69;&#x63;&#x63;&#x61;&#x72;&#x64;&#x6F;&#x2E;&#x70;&#x75;&#x63;&#x65;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x61;&#x40;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#x69;&#x6E;&#x2E;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;)</li>

          <li><b>Office hours:</b> MH 353 / Mon 4-5pm (before class), or over Zoom by request
          </li>

          <li><b>Textbook:</b> There is no required textbook for the course. We will be working off
            notes and online references. In particular, I will share the first two chapters of Hubie
            Chen's upcoming <i>Computability and Complexity</i>, courtesy of MIT Press. This will be
            the source of our readings.

          </li>

          <li><b>Recommended Books:</b> There are several excellent books covering the first part of
            the course (aka, Theory of Computation), but they are a bit expensive considering that
            we will be covering only a small part of their content. If you need extra assistance,
            though, any of these books would be useful, and they are on reserve in the Olin library:
            
            <ul>
              <li>Sisper, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/1133187811">Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a></i></li>
	      <li>Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Theory-Languages-Computation/dp/0321455363">Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation</a></i></li>
            </ul>
            
            An inexpensive and reasonable book is the following, although it uses Ruby instead of OCaml:
            <ul>
	      <li>Stuart, <i><a href="http://computationbook.com">Understanding Computation</a></i></li>
            </ul>
            It very much follows the spirit of this iteration of FoCS. Again, not required. But if you enjoy the course, you may enjoy the book.
            
          </li>

          
          <li><b>Programming:</b> All programming in this course will be done using the programming
            language <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. The OCaml compiler can be downloaded
            from the web site, and supports installations on most common systems. You can find the installation instructions <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/up_and_running.html">here</a>. (You only need to install up to and including <b>Configuring Your Editor</b>. We are not going to use the <b>Dune</b> build system.)

            Here are a couple of reasonable books on OCaml that you might want to get your hands on
            if you prefer learning your programming language from a book instead of the web:
            
            <ul>
              <li>Hickey, <i><a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf">Introduction
	            to Objective Caml</a></i> (PDF)</li>
              <li>Downey, Monje, <i><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkocaml/">Think
	            OCaml</a></i></li>
	      <li>Minsky, Madhavapeddy, Hickey, <i><a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">Real World
	            OCaml</a></i></li>
            </ul>

            Some online resources:
            <ul>
              
	      <li>The OCaml website has a few
	      good <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/">tutorials</a>. At the very least,
	      read
	      through <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/a_first_hour_with_ocaml.html">A
	      First Hour with OCaml</a> which gives you the basics of interacting with OCaml.</li>
              
	      <li>The <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/index.html">official OCaml
	          manual</a></li>
              
	      <li>Some information on
	        the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/toplevel.html#sec256">commands
	        you can use in the OCaml shell</a>, which can be useful</li>
              
	      <li>There are no official IDEs for OCaml, but many people swear
	        by <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop"><i>utop</i></a>, which is an OCaml shell
	        replacement. There's also
	        <a href="http://camelia.sourceforge.net/"><i>Camelia</i></a>,
	        but I've never used it. There is
	        an <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/">Eclipse
	          plug-in</a> for OCaml.
	      </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li><b>Grading:</b> The final grade is based on weekly
            homework (60%), in-class quizzes (20%), and a final exam
            (20%). All work will be done individually. Late homeworks
            will be penalized (10% per 24 hours) and no homework will
            be accepted after its solution has been discussed in
            class. <b>Please do not post your homework code on a
            publicly available repository like GitHub.</b> I hate to
            do this kind of policing, but we've had some issues in the
            past, and I'd like to avoid a repeat if possible.  </li>

           <p>The mathematical notions we'll be using are in Chen above. Here's <a href="languages.pdf">additional notes</a> on what I presented in class (included things I did not cover on regular expressions.)</p>
           
           <p>A reasonably straightforward mathematical account or why it's impossible
           to <a href="http://www.warwickmaths.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/81_-Squaring-the-Circle_-Ancient-Problems-and-Modern-Solutions.pdf">square the circle</a>
           using only straight edge and compass. The argument amounts to showing that &pi;
           is transcendental, that is, is not the root of any polynomial equation.</p>
           
           <p>Some interesting history about
             the <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Quadratic_etc_equations.html">quadratic,
             cubic, and quartic equations</a>, including the <i>solve-offs</i> that mathematicians
             held in the 1500s. They are rather naturally bound to the discovery of complex
             numbers. Some details
             on <a href="http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/factor/fac11/fac11.html">how to solve a
             cubic equation</a>, if you're curious.</p>
	   
	   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems">Hilbert's problems</a>, ten of
	     which were presented at the ICM in Paris in
	     1900. His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_tenth_problem">tenth
	       problem</a>, on the solvability of Diphantine equations, spoke directly to the notion of
	     computation.</p>
           
	   <p>When talking about set comprehension, I mentioned that there usually needs to be some
	     restrictions on the properties allowed in order to ensure that the sets can be constructed
	     by comprehension. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/">Russell's
	       Paradox</a> is why we need such restrictions.</p>
           
	   <p>You may have noticed that union, intersection, and complementation of sets were defined
	     using set comprehensions that uses conjunction, disjunction, and negation,
	respectively. This close connection between set operations and logic is a reflection of the
	     fact that sets form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean
	       algebra</a>.</p>

           <p>Reading: Chen, Sections 1.1 - 1.4.</p>

           <p>Some <a href="automata.pdf">additional notes</a> on what I presented in class. (This presentation assumes we have regular expressions for the proof that finite state machines accept regular languages.)</p>
           
           <p>One reason we study nondeterministic forms of finite
              automata is that they can be easier to describe than
              deterministic finite automata. More specifically, there
              exists languages that can be accepted by
              nondeterministic finite automata with N states whose
              smallest deterministic finite automata that accept those
              same languages have at least 2<sup>N</sup> states. One
              example is the language over {<tt>a</tt>,<tt>b</tt>}
              consisting of all strings whose Nth from last symbol
              is <tt>a</tt>. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NFA_with_exponential_blown-up_DFA.gif">Here
              is an illustration</a> of the subset construction for
              that language, over alphabet {0,1}, and N=4.</p>

      <li><p><span class="hdr">Feb 13: </span><b>Higher-order programming in OCaml</b></p>
	<div class="lect">

	  <p>My personal notes on <a href="regular.pdf">regular and non-regular languages</a> that cover the first half of the lecture. These notes include a discussion of regular expressions, which I did not talk about but you should feel free to read. Regular expressions are just a convenient notation for regular languages, and are used to search for patterns in text. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/3261/fall07/handout/egrep_mini-tutorial.htm">Here is an example of how they are used in egrep</a>. Note that the equivalence between regular expressions and regular languages only holds for <i>pure</i> regular expressions. Most regular expression packages used in practice extend regular expressions in ways that let you express non-regular languages.</p>
	  
          <p>An <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html">interesting article by Brian Kernighan</a> on elegant code for regular expression matching. Note that Kernighan's definition of regular expressions is more restricted than ours. (The point of the article is not regular expressions, but elegant code.)</p>
	    
          <p>The script for <a href="notes-functional.html">higher-order programming</a> that I mostly followed. Worth reading, as it talks about details that I skipped in places.</p>

If you want to practice, you can try to modify the machine to accept the languages {<tt>a</tt><sup>m</sup><tt>b</tt><sup>n</sup> | n &ge; m &ge; 0} and {<tt>a</tt><sup>n</sup><tt>b</tt><sup>n</sup><tt>c</tt><sup>n</sup> | n &ge; 0}.</p>

	  <p>As I mentioned, we can create a variant of finite automata that do not use a tape but that

            <p><a href="non-computability.pdf">Slides</a> from lecture.</p>

            <p>I made remarks in class about the fact that the non-computability (also known as <i>undecidability</i>) of the halting problem for Turing machines impacts, via the Church-Turing thesis, any kind of reasoning that we wish to make about programs in modern programming languages. Matthew Might has an accessible account that <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/intro-static-analysis/">describes how the non-computability of the halting problem impacts static analysis of programs</a>.

            <p>Here's a problem that is non-computable but doesn't involve Turing machines or interpreters for programming languages, showing that there are reasonable problems that are non-computable: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem">Post Correspondence Problem</a>. Here's a <a href="pcp-proof.pdf">proof of non-computability</a> from Sipser, basically showing that you can reduce the Halting Problem for Turing machines to PCP.</p>

      <li><p><span class="hdr">Mar 20: </span><b>Production grammars</b></p>
	  <div class="lect">

            <p>Succinct <a href="./grammars.pdf">notes</a> from the lecture. It includes the
            construction of the unrestricted grammar that can simulate a given Turing machine. (The
            notes are using a <i>slightly</i> different definition of a Turing machine with a marker
            at the beginning of the tape. It is completely equivalent to our definition of Turing
            machines, by a straightforward application of the Church-Turing thesis.)</p>

            <p>R&eacute;v&eacute;sz's book <a href="https://store.doverpublications.com/0486169375.html">Introduction to Formal Languages</a> is nice little book that covers everything we've done until now (finite automata, Turing machines, computability), but starting from the perspective of grammars. It's worth looking at if you like this material. Dover publications in general are a wonderful source of cheap mathematical material.</p>

	    <p>Grammars are used in linguistics (introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures">Chomsky to study the structure of natural languages</a>) and in computer science to implement parsers, that is, turning a string of symbols into a structured artifact like an Abstract Syntax Tree to represent a program in a form that it more amenable to execution and/or compilation. <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/sc1112/intro-parsing.pdf">Here's
	        a reasonable high-level presentation</a> of the basics of parsing, to give you a flavor.</p>

	    <p>A beautiful application of grammars
	      is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems</a>,
	      a class of grammars that model the growth processes of plant
	      development.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton">Pushdown automata</a> are machine models that exactly capture context-free languages:
              a language A is context-free if and only if you can find a pushdown automaton that accepts A.</p>

            <p>Not strictly about the lambda calculus, but many of the ideas from the lambda calculus are embodied in the Lisp programming language, and I would get my CS membership card revoked if I didn't point you to <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, which uses a Lisp-like language to explore all sorts of ideas for how to approach the art of programming.</p>

	  <p>There are two main sources for the dataflow
	    computational model, neither of which is exactly what I
	    presented: Gilles Kahn's work
	    on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks">Kahn
	      Process Networks</a>, and Jack Dennis's work on
	    <a href="http://www.capsl.udel.edu/courses/cpeg852/2014/slides/Topic-A-Dataflow-part1.pdf">dataflow
	      architectures</a>.</p>

          <p>You can also representing dataflow models programmatically via languages that provide support for infinite streams of values. This is sometimes called <i>stream programming</i>.</p>

          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a> is a functional programming language with lazy evaluation, in which lists can be infinite, and therefore can be used to represent infinite streams of values, as an alternative  The most interesting language coming out of the Haskell tradition is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)">Agda</a>, which pushes a static type system to its limits, turning type checking into theorem proving. It's definitely worth digging into if you have the time.</p>

              <p><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">Generators</a> such as found in Python and other languages can also be used to implement infinite streams of values.</p>

	  <p>The programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_(programming_language)">Lucid</a> embodies some of the ideas of stream programming in an interesting way.</p>

          <p>Wikipedia entry on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus">simply-typed lambda calculus</a>, which the theory underlying what I described in class. (We covered only the first two sections, if that, but we added primitive integer and Boolean types.). The page includes a link to Church's original paper <i><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/28bf/123690205ae5bbd9f8c84b1330025e8476e4.pdf">A Formulation of the Simple Theory of Types</a></i>. The "simple theory of types" is a simplification of the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/">theory that Russell devised</a> to try to get around the paradoxes that he discovered in set theory. Yes, all of this is interrelated.</p>

          <p>(There is actually a relationship between the simply-typed lambda calculus and a form of propositional logic called <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intuitionistic/">intuitionistic propositional logic</a>. That relationship is known as the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and is beautifully laid out in <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf">Philip Wadler's <i>Propositions as Types</i></a>. In short, type checking is proving theorems in a simple logic. This can be pushed incredibly far, where the type system because a full-fledged theorem prover for a powerful logic. If that's intriguing to you, go and explore <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/"><i>Software Foundations</i></a>.)</p>

          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">Type inference</a> is the process of having the compiler infer the types of expressions automatically, before or while doing type checking. OCaml uses a form of the Hindley-Milner type system which admits a complete inference algorithm (linked to from the page above).</p>

          <p>If you like type systems, you can dig into <a href="https://profs.sci.univr.it/~merro/files/harper.pdf">Bob Harper's <i>Practical Foundations for Programming Languages</i></a> which covers type systems and <i>so</i> much more.</p>

          <p>Rust is a language whose type system goes beyond enforcing the kind of safety that OCaml (Java, Scala, etc) type systems enforce — it can be used to enforce <a href="https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/ownership.html">memory ownership</a>.</p>

          <p>Oh, and if you make it this far: I lied in class. When talking about fixed point combinators, I said that OCaml doesn't let you write them because they do not type check, and that you would need a form of "recursive" types to type them. I really meant strict Hindley-Milner type systems. OCaml is a bit more general and does in fact have recursive types, mediated via the algebraic datatypes that I mentioned when talking about option types on one of the homeworks, and those enable you to write a fixed point combinator. To wit:

            <pre>
    type 'a recur =
      | R of ('a recur -> 'a)
    
    let fix f =
      let g x =
        match x with
        | R x -> f (fun v -> x (R x) v) in
      g (R g)
    
    let ffact f n =
      if n = 0 then 1 else n * f (n - 1)
    
    let fact = fix ffact </pre>
            Note the utter lack of <tt>rec</tt> keyword. Yet trying it out shows that <tt>fact</tt> does in fact implement a recursive factorial:
            <pre>
    # #use "fix.ml";;
    type 'a recur = R of ('a recur -> 'a)
    val fix : (('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b = &lt;fun>
    val ffact : (int -> int) -> int -> int = &lt;fun>
    val fact : int -> int = &lt;fun>
    # fact 3;;
    - : int = 6
    # fact 4;;
    - : int = 24
    # fact 10;;
    - : int = 3628800
    # fact 20;;
    - : int = 2432902008176640000 </pre>
