<h1 id="final-project">Final Project</h1>
<p>As a final project for the course, I'm asking you to implement a web app. That web app can be entirely a frontend, a combination of a frontend and a backend, or a server-only API. Make it something that you find interesting. If you need to do some web app work for a SCOPE project, it may be possible to fold that into this project, though we'll need to talk about it.</p>
<p>(I will probably post a few suggestions in the chat room and then here in the next few days, if you're fresh out of ideas.)</p>
<p>I would like each team to send me an email with their proposed project by Thursday April 1, 2021 (23h59). The email should list and CC all team members, and include a brief description of the intended project, including the technology you'll use.</p>
<p>The proposal doesn't have to be final or complete. Think of it as the first part of a conversation. I fully expect we'll have a bit of an exchange trying to flesh out the project and set expectations.</p>
<p>If you have ideas for a project, and you would like to discuss it with me before the proposal, feel free to get in touch.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>This project is to be done in teams of 2. (Teams of 3 are okay, but you'll have to do more.) You may discuss problems with fellow students, but all submitted work must be entirely your team's own, and should not be from any other course, present, past, or future. If you use a solution from another source please cite it.</p>
<p>Your project source code should contain a README text file that lists the members of your team, your email addresses, and any remarks that you wish to make to the instructor. The README should also contain instructions on how to install and run your source, if applicable.</p>
<p>Projects include a programming component (where you create an artifact) and a final presentation in class during the Final Events period. Submission of the programming component should be done either:</p>
<ul>
<li>by emailing me a link to your github repo, or</li>
<li>by zipping up your source code and using the <strong>Submit File</strong> functionality of our <a href="https://chat.rpucella.net">chat room</a></li>
</ul>
<p>by the Final Artifact due date. Only one submission per team, please.</p>
<p>The final presentation should be about fifteen minutes, and describe the problem you're trying to solve and the solution you've implemented, including a demo.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="presentation-guidelines">Presentation Guidelines</h2>
<p>Let's target a 15 minutes presentation.</p>
<p>I would ask that you prepare slides - especially since we're going to do this online.</p>
<p>As far as the structure of the presentation, I will not hold you to anything, but here is a common structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to the web app</li>
<li>Architecture (structure of the code)</li>
<li>Interesting challenges of the problem or implementation</li>
<li>Demo</li>
<li>&quot;What did I learn?&quot;</li>
</ul>
