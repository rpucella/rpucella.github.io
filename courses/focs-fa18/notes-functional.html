    <h1>Notes on Functional Programming</h1>

<h2>Mapping</h2>

    <p>Consider coding the following functions using explicit recursion:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>A function <tt>squares : int list -> int list</tt> that squares every element of a list. For example, 
	      <tt>squares [1;2;3]</tt> should return <tt>[1; 4; 9]</tt></p></li>

      <li><p>A function <tt>diags : 'a list -> ('a * 'a) list</tt> that creates a pair of two same values out of every element of a list. For example, <tt>diags [1;2;3]</tt> should return <tt>[(1,1); (2,2); (3,3)]</tt></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is one way to write those functions:</p>

<pre>
let rec squares xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (x*x)::squares xs'

let rec diags xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (x,x)::diags xs'
</pre>

<p>
It is pretty straightforward to rewrite the previous functions using
an explicit call to a helper function that "does the work" for every 
element of the list.
</p>

<pre>
let square x = x * x

let rec squares xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (square x)::squares xs'


let diag x = (x,x)

let rec diags xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (diag x)::diags xs'
</pre>

<p>
If you examine the rewritten functions, you notice quickly that they all 
share the same structure. In fact, if we replace the recursive function name by
<span class="red">&square;</span> and the helper function name by <tt>&hearts;</tt>, they all
have the structure:
</p>
<pre>
let rec <span class="red">&square;</span> xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (&hearts; x) :: <span class="red">&square;</span> xs'
</pre>

    <p>
      A good programming language should give you the ability to
express the common structure of a set of examples using an abstraction
that lets you recover the original examples by instantiating that
abstraction. 
    </p>
    
<p>
    We can write a function that captures the above structure,
and obtain the original functions as special cases of that
    <i>&uuml;ber</i> function. 
</p>

<p>The function is called <tt>map</tt>, and takes as extra
    argument the <i>function</i> to be applied to every element of the
list.
</p>

<pre>
let rec map f xs =
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x)::(map f xs')
</pre>

The OCaml type inference engine gives it the following beautiful type: <tt>('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list</tt>. 

<p>To use <tt>map</tt>, you need to pass it a function as a first
argument. Thankfully, we have plenty of functions around, and we can
recover our original functions:
</p>

<pre>
let squares xs = map square xs

let diags xs = map diag xs
</pre>

    <p class="aside">(This is an aside.) The function <tt>map</tt> we
    defined above is pre-defined in the OCaml standard library, and
    available as <tt>List.map</tt>. Functions such as <tt>map</tt>
    that take functions as argument and/or return functions are
    called <i>higher-order functions</i>. In mathematics,
    they are called <i>functionals</i>. </p>

    <h2>Functions as first-class values</h2>
    
    <p>
      Passing functions around is made possible by the fact that
functions in OCaml (and in many other languages, including JavaScript
      and Python) are just like
any other value: they can be passed around to other functions, they
      can be returned from functions, they can be operated on. This is often captured by saying that functions are <i>first-class values</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
We have been using functions by giving them names, and passing those
names around. This is fine, but imagine what it would be like if every
time you wanted to use, say, an integer, you had to name it. That is,
if instead of writing <tt>1+2</tt>, you had to write
<pre>
let one = 1 in
let two = 2 in 
  one + two
</pre>
That'd get old fast. You can use integers without naming them. 
It is also possible to use functions without naming then. 
These are called <i>anonymous
  functions</i>, and they are created in OCaml with the syntax:
<pre>
fun x -> <i>expr</i>
</pre>
where <tt><i>expr</i></tt> is an expression representing the body of the function. Thus, for
example, we can rewrite our functions using <tt>map</tt> and
anonymous functions as follows:
    </p>
    
  <pre>
let squares xs = map (fun x -> x * x) xs

let diags xs = map (fun x -> (x,x)) xs
</pre>
  
<p>It tends to make OCaml happier when you wrap anonymous functions in
parentheses, like <tt>(fun x -> x * x)</tt>, because it sometimes
  gets confused trying to figure out where the function body ends.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the function definition notation we have been using, such as:
<pre>
let square x = x * x
</pre>
is just a convenient abbreviation for:
<pre>
let square = (fun x -> x * x)
</pre>
which illustrates that <tt>fun x -> x * x</tt> is a value like any other,
to which we happen to give name <tt>square</tt>. Understanding this, that
functions are just values that can be given a name if we want to, is key to
understanding all that follows. 
</p>

    <p class="aside">Viewing <tt>let f x = ...</tt> as an abbreviation
    for <tt>let f = (fun x -> ...)</tt> is only true for non-recursive
    functions. Recursive functions are handled differently, which is
    one of the reasons why OCaml requires a <tt>rec</tt> keyword to
    indicate that a function is recursive. What would an anonymous recursive function look like?</p>
    

<p>
  As an exercise, consider coding the following functions using <tt>map</tt>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>A function <tt>triples : int list -> (int * int * int) list</tt>
    that creates a triple (<i>i</i>,<i>i</i>+1,<i>i</i>+2)$ for every element <i>i</i> in a
  list. For example,  <tt>triples [0; 10; 20]</tt> should return <tt>[(0,1,2); (10,11,12);
        (20,21,22)]</tt></p></li>

  <li><p>A function <tt>thirds : ('a * 'b * 'c) list -> 'c list</tt> that extracts the third component of every triple in a list. For example, <tt>thirds [(1,2,3); (4,5,6); (7,8,9)]</tt> should return <tt>[3; 6; 9]</tt></p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>
      Here's the simplest way using anonymous functions:
    </p>

<pre>
let triples xs = map (fun x -> (x,x+1,x+2)) xs

let thirds xs = map (fun (a,b,c) -> c) xs
</pre>

<p>Let's ratchet up the difficulty a notch. Consider coding the following
  function using <tt>map</tt>:
</p>


<ul>
  <li><p>A function <tt>scale : int -> int list -> int list</tt> take a scaling integer and a list of integers, and returning the list of every integer in the list but scaled by the first integer. For example, <tt>scale 3 [1;4;9]</tt> should return <tt>[3; 12; 27]</tt></p>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The easiest way is to use an anonymous function:
<pre>
let scale a xs = map (fun x -> a*x) xs
</pre>
</p>

<p>
But what if we wanted to give the anonymous function a name, and
define it before using it in <tt>map</tt>? That's the tricky bit. If we
define it locally inside <tt>scale</tt>, it's still easy:
<pre>
let scale a xs = 
  let multiplier x = a*x in
  map multiplier xs
</pre>
</p>

<p>
But what if, mischievously, we wanted to define the helper function <tt>multiplier</tt>
    <i>outside</i> of <tt>scale</tt>, perhaps because we wanted to use it in other functions? Can we do it? Try, go ahead.
</p>

<p>
  Intuitively, function <tt>multiplier</tt> depends on two things:
an <tt>a</tt>, and an <tt>x</tt>. When defined
within <tt>scale</tt>, <tt>multiplier</tt> gets passed on these only
(namely, <tt>x</tt>). The <tt>a</tt> is implicit, available in the
defining environment of <tt>multiplier</tt>. We need to make
this <tt>a</tt> explicit when defining <tt>multiplier</tt> outside the
function. But we can't have <tt>multiplier</tt> take two arguments, or
we couldn't easily pass it to <tt>map</tt> without wrapping it into
  another function.</p>

<p>One solution is write a
  function <tt>mkMultiplier</tt> that takes the <tt>a</tt> and <i>creates</i>
the appropriate <tt>multiplier</tt> function that works with that
  <tt>a</tt> and that can be passed into <tt>map</tt>: 
</p>

<pre>
let mkMultiplier a = 
  fun x -> (a,x)

let scale a xs = map (mkMultiplier a) xs
</pre>

<p>
Function  <tt>mkMultiplier</tt> returns a new function, and it is
    <i>that</i> new function that we give as an argument
  to <tt>map</tt>, via the call <tt>mkMultiplier
      a</tt>.</p>

<p class="aside">
Some trivia about nomenclature: the function returned
from <tt>mkMultiplier</tt> refers to the <tt>a</tt> that is passed as
an argument to <tt>mkMultiplier</tt>. In order for this to make sense,
the system has to remember the value for the <tt>a</tt> that was
passed in when it returns the function. Internally, the system does
this by associating an environment with the returned function
containing the values for the free variables in the function. A
function and its associated environment is usually called
a <i>closure</i>, and so sometimes you hear of these kind of functions
returned from other functions as closures.
</p>

<p>
Note the type of <tt>mkMultiplier</tt>: it has type <tt>int -> int ->
    int</tt>. This looks like the type of a function of two arguments.
    And in fact, it is! A two-arguments
    function <tt><i>T<sub>1</sub></i> -> <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>
    -> <i>T<sub>3</sub></i></tt> is really a function that expects a
    value of type <tt><i>T<sub>1</sub></i></tt> and returns a function
    of type <tt><i>T<sub>2</sub></i> -> <i>T<sub>3</sub></i></tt>,
    that is, a function that expects a value of
    type <tt><i>T<sub>2</sub></i></tt> and returns a value of
    type <tt><i>T<sub>3</sub></i></tt>.
</p>

<p>
For example, the two argument function definition 
<pre>
let add x y = x + y
</pre>
is just an abbreviation for
<pre>
let add x = fun y -> x + y
</pre>
When we call this function, we write
<pre>
add 1 2
</pre>
Application associates to the left, and the above is in fact
equivalent to:
<pre>
(add 1) 2 
</pre>
that is, calling function <tt>add</tt> with argument <tt>1</tt>,
getting back a function of one argument, and then calling that
function with argument <tt>2</tt>. It all works seamlessly.

<p>
That's how we've been working all along. Function 
<tt>add</tt> looks like it's a two argument function, but really,
it's a function returning a function.</p>

<p class="aside">More nomenclature trivia: a function such
  as <tt>add</tt>, written in such a way that it looks like a
  multi-argument function but really takes them one after the other in
  a cascade of functions, is called a <i>curried function</i> &mdash;
  named after the logician Haskell Curry.
</p>

    <p>
      This means that we can write our functin <tt>mkMultiplier</tt> as:
<pre>
let mkMultiplier a x = a * x
</pre>
and it behaves just same as the previous <tt>mkMultiplier</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The curried notation extends. For instance:
</p>
<pre>
let add x y z = x+y+z
</pre>
is an abbreviation for
<pre>
let add x = fun y -> (fun z -> x+y+z)
</pre>
and of course, it is also equivalent to
<pre>
let add x y = fun z -> x+y+z
</pre>
and in fact if we remember that defining functions in the first place
is an abbreviation, the three definitions above are also equivalent
to:
<pre>
let add = fun x -> (fun y -> (fun z -> x+y+z))
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The curried notation also extends to anonymous functions, so that
<tt>fun x y -> <i>expr</i></tt> is really an abbreviation for <tt>fun x -> (fun y
  -> <i>expr</i>)</tt>, and thus the above definitions for <tt>add</tt> are also
equivalent to:
<pre>
let add = fun x y z -> x+y+z
</pre>
I could go on all day. I trust you get the gist.
</p>
    
    <p>
      One advantage of using curried functions is that it supports
      partial application. Consider:
<pre>
let add (x,y,z) = x+y+z
</pre>
If you pass only two arguments to <tt>add</tt>:
<pre>
# add 1 2;;
- : int -> int = &lt;fun>
</pre>
You don't get an error. You get back a function. Which makes perfect
sense. (What does the function you get back do, though?) This is
called <i>partial application</i>. Indeed:
<pre>
# let add3to = add 1 2;;
val add3to : int -> int = &lt;fun>  
# add3to 10;;
- : int = 13
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's finish with an example showing both functions passed as
arguments and returned as results.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      First, define the following curried functions:
<pre>
let add n m = n + m 
let mult n m = n * m
</pre>
Easy enough. Partial application leads to some interesting behavior. For instance, <tt>add 5</tt> gives you back a
function that always adds <tt>5</tt> to its input; <tt>mult 6</tt> gives you
back a function that always multiplies its input by <tt>6</tt>:
<pre>
# let f = add 5;;
val f : int -> int = &lt;fun>
# f 10;;
- : int = 15
# let g = mult 6;;
val g : int -> int = &lt;fun>
# g 10;;
- : int = 60
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can write a functional <i>composition</i> operator that takes two
      functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> and composes them together into a single
      function, corresponding to the mathematical operation <i>g &compfn; f</i>.
<pre>
let compose g f = fun x -> g (f x)
</pre>
Function <tt>compose</tt> has type <tt>('b -> 'c) -> ('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'c)</tt>
    </p>

    
    <p>
      Thus, for example, <tt>compose (add 5) (mult 6)</tt> gives you back a
function (what does it do?) and when you apply that function to <tt>3</tt>,
you get back <tt>23</tt>:
<pre>
# let w = compose (add 5) (mult 6);;
val w : int -> int = &lt;fun>
# w 3;;
- : int = 23
# w 10;;
- : int = 65
</pre>
The definition of <tt>compose</tt> above is equivalent to:
<pre>
let compose g f x = g (f x)
</pre>
Why?</p>


<h2>Filtering</h2>

    <p>
      Consider coding the following functions:
<ul>
  <li><p>A function <tt>filter : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list</tt> that takes a predicate and a list and returns the list of elements that satisfy the predicate. For example, <tt>filter (fun x -> x>0) [0;1;-2;3;-4;5]</tt> should return <tt>[1;3;5]</tt></p>
</li>

<li><p>A function <tt>removeEmpty : 'a list list -> 'a list list</tt> that takes a list of sublists and
    returns the list of all non-empty sublists. For example, <tt>removeEmpty [[1;2]; []; [3]; []]</tt> should return <tt>[[1;2];[3]]</tt> </p>
</li>
</ul>
    </p>

    
    <p>
Function <tt>filter</tt> is a straightforward recursive function over lists:
<pre>
let rec filter p xs =
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> if (p x) then x :: (filter p xs') 
                else filter p xs'
</pre>
    </p>

<p>    
Function <tt>removeEmpty</tt> can be defined directly as an explicitly recursive
function, but it can also be defined in terms of <tt>filter</tt>:
<pre>
let removeEmpty xss = 
  filter (fun xs -> match xs with [] -> false | _ -> true) xss
</pre>
</p>

    <p class="aside">Function <tt>filter</tt> is pre-defined in the
      OCaml standard library and available as <tt>List.filter</tt>.</p>

<p>Can we implement <tt>filter</tt> directly using <tt>map</tt>? 
That is, can we define the function as follows?
<pre>
let filter p xs = map ... xs
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Clearly, no: there is no way for <tt>map</tt> by itself to be able to express
<tt>filter</tt>, because <tt>map</tt> has the property that the list it returns
has always the same size as the list it is passed as
argument. Function <tt>filter</tt>, on the other hand, can potentially
shrink the size of the list.
</p>

<p>
Now, <tt>map</tt> by itself cannot implement <tt>filter</tt>, but a slight
variant of <tt>map</tt> can:
<pre>
let rec map_append f xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x) @ (map_append f xs')
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Intuitively, while <tt>map f [x;y;z]</tt> returns the list <tt>[f x; f y;
    f z]</tt>, the call <tt>map_append g [x;y;z]</tt> returns the list <tt>[x1; x2; ...;
    xm; y1; y2; ...; yn; z1; z2; ... zp]</tt>, where <tt>g x = [x1; x2;
    ...; xm]</tt>, <tt>g y = [y1; y2; ...; yn]</tt>, and <tt>g z = [z1; z2; ...;
    zp]</tt>. 
</p>


<p>
As an exercise, consider coding the following functions using <tt>map_append</tt>:
<ul>
  <li><p>A function <tt>flatten : 'a list list -> 'a list</tt> that takes a list of sublists and returns
  a new list with all the sublists' elements in it, in order. For example, <tt>flatten [[1; 2]; [3; 4]; [5]; []; [6; 7]]</tt> should return
      <tt>[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7]</tt>.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>The function <tt>filter</tt> above.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These functions are directly implemented using <tt>map_append</tt>:
<pre>
let flatten xs = map_append (fun x -> x) xs

let filter p xs = 
  map_append (fun x -> if (p x) then [x] else []) xs
</pre>
Note that <tt>flatten</tt> uses the identity function <tt>fun x -> x</tt> as the
transformation.
</p>

<p class="aside">
That <tt>flatten</tt> is <tt>map_append</tt> with an identity function as
transformation suggests that there is a special relationship between
<tt>map_append</tt> and <tt>flatten</tt>. Indeed, if instead of defining
<tt>map_append</tt>, we had defined <tt>flatten</tt> directly, we could derive
<tt>let map_append f xs = flatten (map f xs)</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Functions <tt>map</tt> and <tt>map_append</tt> have a lot in common. Can we make
precise what they have in common and write a single function to capture that commonality?
</p>

<p>
Here is the code for <tt>map</tt> and <tt>map_append</tt>, next to each other:
<pre>
let rec map f xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x) :: (map f xs')

let rec map_append f xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x) @ (map_append f xs')
</pre>
</p>

    <p>
We see they both have the structure:
<pre>
let rec <span class="red">&square;</span> f xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x) &hearts; (<span class="red">&square;</span> f xs')
</pre>
where <tt>&hearts;</tt> is the combination function, <tt>::</tt> for <tt>map</tt>, and
<tt>@</tt> for <tt>map_append</tt>. We can replace that <tt>&hearts;</tt> by a function
that is passed as an argument, and we obtain <tt>general_map_2</tt>:
<pre>
let rec general_map_2 comb f xs = 
  match xs with 
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> comb (f x) (general_map_2 comb f xs')
</pre>
and we can now write, as desired:
<pre>
let map f xs = general_map_2 (fun x ys -> x :: ys) f xs

let map_append f xs = general_map_2 (fun x ys -> x @ ys) f xs
</pre>
    </p>

    <p class="aside">One slight difference between <tt>general_map_2</tt> and the functions that it generalizes is 
      that the latter use infix operations, such as <tt>::</tt> and <tt>@</tt>.</p>

    <p>
      The <tt>_2</tt> in the name is to indicate
      that <tt>general_map_2</tt> takes two functions to fill
      placeholders. But,  passing in both <tt>comb</tt> and <tt>f</tt> as arguments to <tt>general_map_2</tt>
is unnecessary: a suitable combination function can play the role of
both <tt>comb</tt> and <tt>f</tt>:
<pre>
let rec general_map comb xs = 
  match xs with 
  | [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> comb x (general_map comb xs')
</pre>
and to see that we have not lost any generality, we can implement the
original <tt>general_map_2</tt> using <tt>general_map</tt>:
<pre>
let general_map_2 comb f xs = 
  general_map (fun x ys -> comb (f x) ys) xs
</pre>
    </p>


    <h2>Folding</h2>

    <p>
Can we go even more general? If you look carefully at <tt>general_map</tt>,
or feed it to OCaml, you see it has type
<pre>
('a -> 'b list -> 'b list) -> 'a list -> 'b list
</pre>
In particular, the result of calling <tt>general_map</tt> is always a
list.
    </p>

    <p>
Now, there are functions on lists that do not return lists, but still
have a lot in common with <tt>general_map</tt>. For instance, <tt>sum</tt>, with its
obvious recursive definition:
<pre>
let add m n = m + n

let rec sum xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> 0
  | x :: xs' -> add x (sum xs')
</pre>
where I use <tt>add</tt> instead of <tt>+</tt> in <tt>sum</tt> to emphasize the commonality with
<tt>general_map</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
Look at the code for <tt>general_map</tt> and <tt>sum</tt> next to each other. One
difference is that <tt>sum</tt> embeds its combination function <tt>add</tt>
directly in the code, which is fine. We can imagine pulling it out as
an argument:
<pre>
let rec general_sum comb xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> 0
  | x :: xs' -> comb x (general_sum comb xs')
</pre>
Now, the code for <tt>general_map</tt> and <tt>general_sum</tt> are very similar, and share
the following structure:
<pre>
let rec <span class="red">&square;</span> comb xs = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> &hearts;
  | x :: xs' -> comb x (<span class="red">&square;</span> comb xs')
</pre>
where <tt>&hearts;</tt> is the difference between the functions, namely the
value returned by the function on an empty list. So we can do as
we did for <tt>general_map</tt>, and simply make that difference a parameter to
the function. We get the following function, which we call <tt>fold_right</tt>:
<pre>
let rec fold_right comb xs base = 
  match xs with
  | [] -> base
  | x :: xs' -> comb x (fold_right comb xs' base)
</pre>
This function has type <tt>('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b ->
  'b</tt>.</p>

    <p>
After a moment's thought, we see that:
<pre>
let general_map comb xs = fold_right comb xs [] 

let sum xs = fold_right add xs 0 
</pre>
Function <tt>fold_right</tt> is super interesting. It does nothing by itself
except recurse. Everything else is delegated to the functions given
  as arguments. It is the <i>essence</i> of
structural recursion on lists. Most recursive functions on lists, as
long as they recurse on the tail of the list, can be implemented in
term of <tt>fold_right</tt> for the appropriate combination function and
base value.
    </p>

<p class="aside">This function <tt>fold_right</tt> is
  pre-defined in the OCaml standard library, and available as
  <tt>List.fold_right</tt>.</p>

    <p>As an exercise, Consider coding the following functions using <tt>fold_right</tt>:
<ul>
  <li><p>The function <tt>removeEmpty : 'a list list -> 'a list list</tt> we saw earlier.</p>
</li>

<li><p>A function <tt>heads : 'a list list -> 'a list</tt> that takes a list of sublists 
    and return the first element of each sublist, skipping over empty lists. For example, <tt>heads [[1;2];[];[3]]</tt> should return <tt>[1;3]</tt>.</p>
</li>

<li><p>A function <tt>concat : string list -> string</tt> that takes a list of strings and returns
  the result of concatenating all the strings together in the order in
  which they appear in the list. For example, <tt>concat ["goodbye ","cruel ";"world"]</tt> should return 
    <tt>"goodbye cruel world"</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
    </p>

    
    <p>
At first, the trick is to first write down the function using
explicit recursion, and then read off the appropriate combination
function and base value. With practice, you can then come up with them
directly:
<pre>
let removeEmpty xs = 
  fold_right (fun x r -> match x with [] -> r | _ -> x::r) 
               xs []

let heads xs = 
  fold_right (fun x r -> match x with [] -> r | y::_ -> y::r) 
               xs []

let concat xs = 
  fold_right (fun x r -> x^r) xs ""
</pre>
    </p>


    <h2>Odds and ends</h2>

    <p>The name <tt>fold_right</tt> suggests that there might be a
      <tt>fold_left</tt>. Indeed there is, and it basically capture
      accumulation-based recursion. It is defined as follows:

      <pre>
let rec fold_left comb base xs =
  match xs with
  | [] -> base
  | x::xs' -> fold_left comb (comb base x) xs'
</pre>

    <p class="aside">Function <tt>fold_left</tt> is pre-defined in the
      OCaml standard library, and available as <tt>List.fold_left</tt>.</p>
<p>     
The typical example of accumulation-based recursion is computing the
      sum of the elements of a list using an accumulator:
      <pre>
let rec sum result xs =
  match xs with
  | [] -> result
  | x::xs' -> sum (result + x) result'
</pre>
You invoke such a function with an initial result of 0, as in <tt>sum
        0 [1;2;3;4;5;6]</tt>.
</p>

    <p>Function <tt>sum</tt> is definable using <tt>fold_left</tt>:
      <pre>
let sum result xs = fold_left (fun a b -> a + b) result xs
</pre>
      or even more succinctly:
      <pre>
let sum = fold_left (fun a b -> a + b)
</pre>
      
<p class="aside">For the more algebraically-minded among you, I will
  note that if <tt>comb</tt> is a commutative operation, that is, for
  all values <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> of the correct types, <tt>comb
    a b</tt> is equal to <tt>comb b a</tt>, then <tt>fold_right comb
    xs base</tt> and <tt>fold_left comb base xs</tt> return equal
  results.</p>


    <p>Functions as first-class values are not unique to OCaml, but
    they are particularly well-suited to the language because of the
    implicit use of curried functions to define multi-argument
      functions.</p>

    <p>Most modern languages worth anything have functions as
    first-class values. In Python, you can pass functions as
    arguments and return them from functions, and you can define
      anonymous functions using <tt>lambda x : ...</tt>. The body of
    an anonymous function in Python must be an expression. Functions <tt>map</tt> and <tt>filter</tt> are
    available as built-in, and <tt>fold_left</tt> is available as
      function <tt>reduce</tt>. For example:
<pre>
>>> reduce (lambda a,b : (a,b), [1,2,3,4,5])
((((1, 2), 3), 4), 5)
</pre>
 As near as I can tell, there is no
equivalent of <tt>fold_right</tt>.
Many of the uses of higher-order functions such as <tt>map</tt>
and <tt>filter</tt> in Python are handled using list comprehensions,
an astonishingly convenient notation. But under the hood, list
comprehensions desugar into uses of <tt>map</tt> and <tt>filter</tt>. 
    </p>


<p>Modern Javascript uses functions as arguments all over the place,
  since asynchronous programming is callback-based in Javascript, and
  what is a callback but a function that's passed as an argument to
  another function to be called when the function is done?
  Recent development in Javascript have hidden this use of callbacks
  under <tt>async</tt>/<tt>await</tt> and that's a really good thing,
  but it doesn't change the fact that most of the uses of the language
  for interactive programming require callbacks. Arrow notation, a
  recent-ish development, even make anonymous functions look like
  anonymous functions in OCaml, as in <tt>(a,b) => a+b</tt>. List
  objects have methods <tt>map</tt> and <tt>filter</tt> that take
  functions as arguments and operate like the functions of the same
  name in OCaml, while <tt>fold_left</tt> is available as a
  method <tt>reduce</tt> of list objects:
<pre>
> [1,2,3,4].reduce((a,b) => [a,b])
[ [ [ 1, 2 ], 3 ], 4 ]
</pre>
</p>

<p>In fact, the cleanest way to loop over the elements of a list in
  Javascript is to use method <tt>forEach</tt> of a list object, that
  takes a function as argument and calls that function on every
  element of the list, from left to right. This is fresh code from a
  project of mine at work:
<pre>
function aggregate (rows,get_parts) { 

  let result = {}

  rows.forEach(r => {
    let key_parts = get_parts(r);
    let key = key_parts.filter(kp => kp.key).map(kp => kp.value).join("-");
    if (!(key in result)) {
        result[key] = initRow();
    }
    result[key] = addRow(result[key],r);
  });

  ...
</pre>
What it does is not important &mdash; it's part of an aggregation routine
that loops over a list of objects and aggregates all the objects whose
field values returned by function <tt>get_parts</tt> map to the same string
when concatenated together. But note that there are three higher-order
functions used: <tt>forEach</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>, and <tt>map</tt>,
and one instance of calling a function <tt>f</tt> passed as an
argument. This is pretty typical Javascript code.</p>
