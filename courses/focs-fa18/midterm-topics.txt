FORMAL LANGUAGES: definitions of strings and languages, operations on
languages.

- you should be able to determine if a string belongs to a language
  described by applying operations such as union, concatenation, and
  star.


REGULAR LANGUAGES: definitions of regular expressions, finite automata
(deterministic and nondeterministic), properties of regular languages,
examples of regular languages, examples of non-regular languages.

- you should be able to describe the language denoted by a given
  regular expressiion
- you should be able to describe the language accepted by a given
  finite  automaton  
- you should be able to give a regular expression denoting a given
  regular language
- you should be able to create a finite automaton accepting a given 
  regular language


TURING MACHINES: definitions of Turing machines, configurations,
enumerable languages, decidable languages, totality.

- you should be able to determine the language accepted by a given
  Turing machine
- you should be able to create a Turing machine accepting a given
  language


OCAML PROGRAMMING

- you should be able to create or complete small functions (at the
  level of the easy functions in the first homework).
