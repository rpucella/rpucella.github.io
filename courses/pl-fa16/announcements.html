	    <a href="project.html">Some notes on the final
	      project</a>. <b>Reminder</b>: by November 18th, please send me a
	    quick description of what you propose to do for your final
	    project.  I'm happy to discuss anything you have in mind
	    before then, of course. The link I gave you has some
	    suggestions, in case you're stumped, but don't feel
	    constrained by them. The final presentations will be
	    during our Final Assessment period on December 13 (4-7pm).</p>
	</li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Nov 8:</span>
	    Full lecture notes on compilation, for the last two classes, are available below, along with sample code.
	</p></li>
	
	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Nov 2:</span>
	    <a foo="./homework7.html">Homework 7</a> is out. Due Friday Nov 18, right before Thanksgiving Break.
	</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Nov 2:</span>
	    Notes and sample code for our first lecture on compilation available.
	</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 31:</span>
	    Notes and sample code for the lecture on continuations now available below.
	</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 27:</span>
	    Additional instructions for Homework 6 submission: Along with your usual submission of the <tt>homework6.py</tt> file containing your source code, please describe in your submission email (or a subsequent email if you've already submitted <tt>homework6.py</tt>) how you answered the various questions. More specifically:<br><br>
	    For Question (1), describe the syntax of your for-loop implementation, and show a transcript of running your shell and some example of your for-loop in action.<br><br>
	    For Question (2), show a transcript of running your shell and running all the required operations on strings.<br><br>
	    For Question (3), describe briefly how you implemented procedures (so I can navigate your code) and give a transcript of defining and using procedures from your shell.<br><br>
	    For Question (4), again describe briefly how you implemented arrays (so I can navigate your code) and give a transcript of defining and using arrays from your shell. Give the full code of your quicksort procedure, and give a transcript of running it from your shell.<br><br>
	    You can also add the above as a long comment at the bottom of your homework6.py file. Just let me know that it's there in your email.<br><br>
	  The above doesn't have to be long. It just has to tell me what to look for and how to test your code.<br><br>
	    Because you may not have factored the above into your work time, I'll happily accept submissions for homework 6 until Saturday 5pm.

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 27:</span> 
	    Updated the lecture notes on objects to add a section about inheritance. Also added some <a href="code-lect-06-obj-inheritance.py">sample code for an object system with inheritance</a>.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 22:</span> 
	    Question 4 of <a foo="homework6.html">Homework 6</a> is out. 
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 21:</span>
	    Notes and sample code from the lecture on objects now available.
	</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 15:</span>
	    The first part of <a foo="homework6.html">Homework 6</a> is out. The second part (Question 4) will be added after the next lecture, since it will involve objects.</p>	</li>
	
	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 14:</span>
	    Added the <a href="code-lect-05-refs.py">sample code</a> from the Mutable State lecture.</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 11:</span>
	    Slight modification to the top-level environments in Homework 5 to make answering Question 3 a bit easier. If you already started changing the file, just copy the new <tt>initial_env()</tt> and <tt>initial_env_curry()</tt> functions. (There were weird corner cases that could go wrong in the earlier version. My changes make the hint I gave unnecessary.)</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 11:</span>
	    Slides and notes for the lecture on mutable state are available below. Sample code will be available on Friday after homework 5 is due, since it will contain solutions to some of the homework's questions.</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 6:</span>
	    <a foo="homework5.html">Homework 5</a> is out. Note the due date.
	</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Oct 4:</span>
	    Slides and code for the lecture on first-class functions are available below.
	</p></li>
	
	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 29:</span>
	    Second (last) question of <a foo="homework4.html">Homework 4</a> is out.
	</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 28:</span>
	    First question of <a foo="homework4.html">Homework 4</a> is out.
	</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 22:</span>
	    Slightly modified Question 2(a) on <a foo="homework3.html">Homework 3</a> to specify the result of <tt>parse</tt>.
	</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 21:</span>
	    <a foo="homework3.html">Homework 3</a> is out.
	</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 20:</span>
	    Slides and code for the lecture on surface syntax are available below.
	    I've simplified and corrected the slides somewhat; the recursive-descent parser pseudocode now correctly tracks the tokens left unparsed. I've also added a bunch of relevant links. Please install <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/">Pyparsing</a> and start reading the docs. </p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 15:</span> I just realized that a change that I made to the homework last night didn't actually commit. It's a simplifying change. For <tt>ELetV</tt> and <tt>ELetN</tt> in Question 2, you do not need to support simultaneous bindings. Just have <tt>ELetV</tt> and <tt>ELetN</tt> handle a single binding, the way my original <tt>ELet</tt> worked before you modified it in Question 1.</p>
</li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 14:</span>
	    <a foo="homework2.html">Homework 2</a> fully out.
	</p></li>
	    
	    <li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 14:</span>
	    First question of <a foo="homework2.html">homework 2</a> is out. I'll add the remaining two questions after dinner. Since I'm giving you this a day later than I wanted, I'll drop one of the things I was going to ask you (or just make it an additional extra). Thanks for your patience.</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 13:</span>
	    Slides and code for the lecture on identifiers and the
	    substitution model are available
	    below. Homework 2 should be out soon.</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 7:</span>
	    I've added the sample outputs to homework 1. That should give you something to test. Also, I added the obvious missing question from part (3), namely extending <tt>EPlus</tt>, <tt>EMinus</tt>, and <tt>ETimes</tt> to work with rationals. Sorry about the overlook.</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 6:</span>
	    Slides and code for the first lecture are available below. <a foo="homework1.html">Homework 1</a> is out, due next Monday. I will put in some sample outputs tomorrow morning.</p></li>

      	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Sep 1:</span>
	    Happy start of the semester!</p></li>
