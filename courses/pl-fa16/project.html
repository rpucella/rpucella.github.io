    <p class="subtitle">Topic Proposals Due date: Friday, Nov 18, 2016<br>
    Final Presentations: Tuesday, Dec 13, 2016 (4-7pm, AC326)</p>
    

    <p><b>Note on integrity:</b> This project is meant to be done in teams of two. 
    You may discuss problems with fellow students, but
    all work must be entirely that of your team, and should not be from any
    other course, present, past, or future. If you use a solution from
    another source you must cite it &mdash; this includes when that source
      is someone else helping you.</p>

    <p>Every source file you submit should begin with a block comment
      that lists <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the members of your team</span>, your <span style="text-decoration:underline;">email addresses</span>, and any <span style="text-decoration:underline;">remarks</span> that you
      wish to make to the instructor.</p>

    <p>Projects include a programming component (where you create an
    artifact) and a final presentation in class during the Final Assessments
    period. Submission of the programming component should be done by
    sending source code and any attendant supporting files
    to <tt>pl.fa16.olin@gmail.com</tt> by the time of the final
      presentation. Only one email per team, please.</p>

    <p>The final presentation should be about fifteen minutes, and
    describe the problem you're trying to solve and the solution
      you've implemented, including a demo.</p>

    </ul>

<hr>

<p>As a final project for the course, I'm going to ask you to choose a
  topic related to programming languages that you would like to
  investigate and that we have not covered in the course, or that we
  have not covered deep enough for your taste. This can take the form
  of extending or modifying one of the interpreters or compilers that
  we developed in the course, or come up with a completely different
  one.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some possible topics that have come to my mind over the
  last few weeks. Some of these are things that I thought about
  talking about in class but ran out of time, others are logical
  follow-ups to things we've seen, and others are just a completely
  different take on programming:

  <ul>
    <li>Indentation-aware parsing (in the style of Python)</li>

    <li>Exceptions</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">Type inference</a></li>

    <li>Support
    for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)">array
	processing in the style of J</a></li>
    
    <li>Support for matrix processing in the stle of Matlab or R (where
      operations automatically lift to vectors or matrices)</li>

    <li>Implement a subset of a specific programming
      language the implementation of which you are curious about</li>

    <li>Improve the compilation process for the compiler we developed
      in class by implementing optimizations such
      as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">constant
      folding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion">function
	inlining</a></li>

    <li>Compile the register machine code presented in class further
      all the way to assembly language, or to C</li>

    <li>Write a small interpreter for
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming language</a></li>

    <li>Write a small interpreter for a <a href="http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home">probabilistic
	programming language</a></li>

  </ul>
  (I'll be adding to this list throughout the week.)</p>

<p>
  If any of these topics interest you, please get in touch with me,
  and I can provide some guidance and stuff to read. If you have
  another idea for a project, and you would like to discuss it with me
  (maybe because you're wondering about the scope of what you want to
  do), please get in touch.</p>
