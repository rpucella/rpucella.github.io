    <p>This course is an introduction to the theory, design, and
    implementation of programming languages. Topics covered may
    include: semantics of programming languages, types, higher-order
    functions and lambda calculus, objects, laziness, continuations,
    monads, objects, and concurrency. Class work revolves around the
    implementation of interpreters for a variety of small programming
    languages.</p>

            Some quick notes on <a href="./continuations.pdf">transforming arbitrary recursive functions</a> into a version that uses only recursive tail calls. The idea is to transform the function into so-called <i>continuation-passing style</i>. Continuation-passing style is mostly used to help implement compilers for functional programming languages, going back to the original <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6913">RABBIT compiler</a> for Scheme.

      <h3>Course Information</h3>

      <p>Prerequisites: Programming experience (ENGR 2510 for instance).</p>

      <p>Instructor: <a href="http://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (<a id="send_email" href="#">send email</a>)</p>

      <p>Office hours: Thu 16:00-18:00 / MH 353, or online by appointment</p>

      <p>Textbook: We don't have a textbook. There is nothing out
      there that captures quite what I want to do in this course. I
      will find readings for us to supplement the lectures. 

      If you're looking for reference books that cover some of the
     topics we'll cover, the following might help:
      <ul>
	<li>
         <i><a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/">Programming
	Languages: Application and Interpretation</a></i> by Shriram Krishnamurthy. This is the
	closest book in spirit to what I want to cover in the
	course. It is freely available online. It uses Racket, a
	dialect of Scheme. Definitely worth a read.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Programming: All programming in the course will be done in
	<a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> (version 2.13, though that shouldn't matter an awful lot).
	I will not expect you to know how to program in Scala, but you should have good working knowledge of Python, especially its object model. We'll pick up Scala proper as we go along. A good reference manual is:

      <ul>
	<li><i><a href="https://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_3ed">Programming in Scala</a> 3rd edition</i> by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners. The first edition is <a href="http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/">available online</a>, if you want to check it out. (The core language hasn't changed that much, but I'm not sure how much the first edition carries over when you get to more advanced topics.)</li>
      </ul>

      You can get Scala from
      the <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/download/">official
      download page</a>. Note that if you install Scala on Windows,
      you'll probably want to install the Scala binaries instead of
      using the Scala build tool <tt>sbt</tt> so that you have easy access to the
      interactive compiler. (The Scala build tool <tt>sbt</tt> is
      great, but very much overkill for what we're going to do, at
      least at first.) Scala can be installed from Homebrew on Mac OS
      X. The appropriate .tgz is available for Linux. You can certainly install one of the IDEs if you like, but full disclosure: I've never used them so I don't know how they work. I don't know if they use <tt>sbt</tt>, or whether they are only useful for compile Scala to <tt>.class</tt> files, etc.</p>

      <p>Grading: The final grade is based on weekly homeworks for the
      first five weeks (40%), biweekly homeworks for the following four
      weeks (30%), and a final project (30%). All work to be done in
      teams of two. Late homeworks will be penalized (10% per 24 hours)
      and no homework will be accepted after its solution has been
	discussed in class.</p>

<!--    <p>Ninja: TBD</p> -->

      <p>I expect all of us to follow the <b><a href="http://www.olin.edu/academic-life/student-affairs-resources/student-life/honor-code/">Olin Honor Code</a></b>.</p>

	    <p>The <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html"><i>Tour of Scala</i></a> from the Scala language web page. It's a good overview, but it gets in the weeds quickly. You probably want to focus on <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html">Introduction</a>, <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/basics.html">Basics</a>, <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/unified-types.html">Unified Types</a>, <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/classes.html">Classes</a>, <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/case-classes.html">Case Classes</a>, and <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html">Pattern Matching</a>, at first.</p>
            
	    <p>If you already know Java, <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html"><i>A Scala Tutorial for Java Programmers</i></a> might be useful for you.</p>
            
	    <p>The class hierarchy we will develop for the abstract representation of our languages uses an abstract base class (in the code above, <tt>Exp</tt>). If you've never worked with abstract base classes, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html">you can find a description here</a> for Java &mdash; the discussion applies to Scala in the same way. Abstract classes don't really make sense in Python, so you would not have encountered them there. (Why?)</p>

The official Scala documentation on the <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.1/scala/collection/immutable/List.html">List</a> class is a good reference. The <a href="https://alvinalexander.com/scala/scala-list-class-examples">following tutorial on using lists in Scala</a> is also probably useful. </p>

	  <div class="lect">

	    <p><a href="./lect03-functions.pdf">Slides from the lecture.</a></p>

	    <p>Sample code from the lecture: <a href="./code-lect03-functiondef.scala">functions with global definitions</a>, <a href="./code-lect03-functionval.scala">functions as values</a>, <a href="./code-lect03-function-static.scala">functions with static binding</a>, and <a href="./code-lect03-function-dynamic.scala">functions with dynamic binding</a>,

	    <p>Programming languages that take expressions and functions as their core (if not sole) programs are usually called <i>functional programming languages</i>. A good overview of some advantages of the functional programming approach is given by John Hughes' <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html"><i>Why Functional Programming Matters.</i></a> The first three sections at least should be pretty accessible.</p>
	    
	    <p>A very short description of the <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/03wi/imperative/scoping.html">difference between static binding and dynamic binding</a> (here, and in many places, called static/lexical scoping and dynamic scoping)</p>

	    <p>Here is the example I used in class that illustrates that Python uses static binding (like all modern languages): 
	      <pre>
  def test (x):

    def foo (y) :
      return x + y

    def bar (x):
      return foo(x)

    return bar(200)
</pre>
              Evaluating <tt>test(10)</tt> yields <tt>210</tt>, which is what static
              binding tells you should be the answer. If Python used dynamic
              binding, the result would be <tt>400</tt>, since the binding
              of <tt>x</tt> to <tt>200</tt> in function <tt>bar</tt> would be used
              to resolve the <tt>x</tt> in <tt>foo</tt> when
              evaluating <tt>bar(200)</tt>.</p>
	    
	    <p>If you're into it, you can read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funarg_problem">upward funarg problem</a> that motivated the invention of closures. Be warned, though: it gets deep in the guts of language implementation using a stack <i>&agrave; la</i> C.</p>

	    <p><a href="./lect04-parsing.pdf">Slides from the lecture.</a></p>

	    <p><a href="./code-lect04-parsing.scala">Sample code</a> from the lecture, including a parser for our simple expression language (without functions).</p> Note that this code requires the parser combinators library detailed in the next paragraph.

	    <p>We are going to use the <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators">Scala Standard Parser Combinator Library</a> as our parsing library in Scala. You should be able to access it by writing <tt>import scala.util.parsing.combinator._</tt> in your scala code. This requires you to have loaded the <tt>jar</tt> file in your shell if you run your code in the shell. The easiest way is probably:
              <pre>  scala -classpath scala-parser-combinators_2.13-1.1.2.jar</pre>
              assuming the <tt>jar</tt> file is in the same folder where you start your shell. (If not, you'll need to provide a path to the <tt>jar</tt> file.)
              Alternatively, you can also use the command
              <pre>  :require scala-parser-combinators_2.13-1.1.2.jar </pre>
              from within the shell.
              You can find the <tt>jar</tt> file at the link above, and <a href="./scala-parser-combinators_2.13-1.1.2.jar">I also posted the version for Scala 2.13 here for convenience</a>.
            </p>

            <p>A good starting point to understand the parser combinator library is to read the <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators/blob/1.2.x/docs/Getting_Started.md">Getting Started</a> document, which gives you the core concepts that are needed to understand the code.
              For an in-depth example that uses parser combinators, have a look at <a href="http://enear.github.io/2016/03/31/parser-combinators/">this</a>, but note that it uses concepts from Scala we have not introduced yet. Mostly, we won't be writing parsers from scratch, but rather modifying and extending existing parsers.</p>

	    <p>If you're interested in some of the theory underlying parser combinators, a good starting point is Graham Hutton's <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/parsing.pdf"><i>Higher-Order Functions for Parsing</i></a> tutorial.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/">Regular expressions</a> in Java. (Scala inherits its regular expressions from Java.)</p>

	    <p>For a while at least, the languages we will create will resemble a dialect of <a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/">Scheme</a>, itself a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a>. Until we decide to ditch S-expressions as a surface syntax, that is. You can access an <a href="https://repl.it/languages/scheme">online evaluator for Scheme</a> if you want to try the language out.</p>

	  <div class="lect">
	    
	    <p><a href="./code-lect05.scala">Sample code from the lecture</a>.</p>
	    
	    <p>The idea that we can keep the abstract representation
	    simple while still allowing an extensive surface syntax by
	    using the "trick" of parsing some of the surface syntax
	    into a complex abstract representation is widespread. For
	    instance, the surface syntax <tt>(and x y z)</tt> can
	    parse into
	    roughly <tt>EIf(x,EIf(y,z,false),false)</tt>. In other
	    words, we don't need to introduce abstract representation
	    for everything in the surface
	    syntax. </p> 
 
	    <p>Some languages actually let users define their own surface syntax
	      transformations. Macros
	      in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/r4rs/r4rs_12.html">Scheme</a>
	      and
	      in <a href="https://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/book/macros.html">Rust</a>
	      do exactly that: they allow transformations to be
	      expressed <i>within the language</i>, and their parser
	      can look up those transformations while parsing, instead
	      of requiring the transformations to be hard-wired into
	      the parser. Same process, slightly more flexible
	      approach. (There's a cost to that approach: the parser
	      needs to be more complex because it needs to look up
	      applicable transformations at suitable points. It might
	      be a very nice project to figure out ways of doing just
  that.)</p>

   <p>I mentioned that the core of FUNC (our little language with
  single-argument functions) is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda
  Calculus</a>.</p>

	    <p><a href="./code-lect06.scala">Sample code from the lecture</a>.</p>

	    <p>I greatly simplified the syntactic transformation for C-style mutable state from the one I presented in class. There is no longer any need to do the fancy involved transformation to the primitive operations in the standard environment.</p>
	    
	    <p>I called the first model of mutable state <i>ML-like</i>, after the programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML">ML</a>. Here is a <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bonner/courses/2016f/csc324/handouts/MLreferences.txt">description of reference cells in ML</a> which served as inspiration for the ones in lecture.</p>
	    <p>In the C-style model of mutable state, we talk about <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gbournou/CSE131/l-values_and_r-values.html">lvalues and rvalues</a> to distinguish expressions that fundamentally represent reference cells, versus the value contained those cells.</p>

	    <p>Wikipedia's entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">type systems</a> is reasonable.</p>
            
            <p>At the end of lecture, I mentioned the problem of
	      giving a reasonable type to reference cells. The sample
	      code types function <tt>ref</tt> as <tt>(:fun (:num)
	      (:ref :num))</tt> which can only create reference cells
	      holding numbers. To create reference cells holding
	      Booleans or any other type of value, you need a distinct
	      function of the appropriate type. A more general type
	      for reference cells uses <i>type variables</i> to give
	      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">generic
	      type</a> to <tt>ref</tt>, such as <tt>(:fun [X] (X)
	        (:ref X))</tt>. You can create function with such
	      generic types such as the generic identity
	      function
              <pre>
                (fun [X] ((a X) X) a)</pre> The kicker is
	      when calling such generic functions, you need to
	      explicitly supply the types at which you want to
	      instantiate those type variables. For instance:
              <pre>
                (let ((id (fun [X] ((a X) X) a)))
                  (id [:num] 10))

                (let ((id (fun [X] ((a X) X) a)))
                  (id [:bool] true))</pre>
              <a href="code-lect08-generics.scala">Sample code</a>
              implementing this version of the type system is
              available. To make sure a type system more palatable
              (having to specify type instantiation at application
              time gets old <i>very</i> fast), you can automtically
              figure out the type instantiations
              using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)">unification</a>.
              Languages with these kind of generic types and inference
              at application time are said to
              support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric
              polymorphism</a>
	    </p>
            
	    <p>Even more advanced type systems can be obtained by
              using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type">dependent
                types</a>, which allow types to depend on values! Thus, you can
              write not only the type of vectors over a type A, but you can also
              write a type <tt>(:vec n A)</tt> for vectors of length <i>n</i> over a
              type A, where <i>n</i> is a value in the language. Using such a type
	      system, we can type a concatenate function on vectors with a function type taking arguments
	      <tt>(:vec n A)</tt> and <tt>(:vec m A)</tt> with a
	      return type <tt>(:vec (+ m n) A)</tt>. These type
	      systems have a pretty complex type-checking
	      algorithm.</p>
