# Final Project

## Topics Proposals Due Date: Sunday, April 5, 2020.

## Final Presentations: TBD (either last lecture or during final events)

## Final Artifact Due Date: Sunday, May 10, 2020.

- This project is to be done in teams of 2, or singly. You may
discuss problems with fellow students, but all submitted work must be
entirely your team's own, and should not be from any other course,
present, past, or future. If you use a solution from another source
you must cite it &mdash; this includes when that source is someone
else helping you.

- Every source file you submit should begin with a block comment that
lists the members of your team, your email addresses, and any remarks
that you wish to make to the instructor.

- Projects include a programming component (where you create an
artifact) and a final presentation in class during the Final
Assessments period. Submission of the programming component should be
done by sending source code and any attendant supporting files to
`olin.submissions@gmail.com` by the Final Artifact due date. Only one
email per team, please.

- The final presentation should be about fifteen minutes, and
describe the problem you're trying to solve and the solution
you've implemented, including a demo.

As a final project for the course, I'm going to ask you to choose a
topic related to programming languages that you would like to
investigate and that we have not covered in the course, or that we
have not covered deep enough for your taste. This can take the form
of extending or modifying one of the interpreters or compilers that
we developed in the course, or come up with a completely different
one.

Here are some possible topics that have come to my mind over the
last few weeks. Some of these are things that I thought about
talking about in class but ran out of time, others are logical
follow-ups to things we've seen, and others are just a completely
different take on programming:

- Indentation-aware parsing (as in Python)

- Implement an exception system or a [Lisp-like condition system](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html)

- Implement a debugger with breakpoints for one of our interpreters

- Implement a full object-oriented system (inheritance, class variables, mixins)

- Implement a static type system for objects (with subclassing)

- [Type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference)

- Support for [array processing in the style of J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language))
    
- Support for matrix processing in the style of Matlab or R (where
      operations automatically lift to vectors or matrices)

- Implement a subset of a specific programming
      language the implementation of which you are curious about

- Implement optimizations on our abstract representation such
      as [constant folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding)
      and [function inlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion)
      
- Implement something like the Common Lisp <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/loop-for-black-belts.html">loop</a> macro

- Create a tool for automatically producing a lexer and parser given a description of a grammar

- Write a prototype interpreter for a [logic programming
    language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming)

- Write a prototype interpreter for a [probabilistic programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming)

- Write a prototype interpreter for a [stack-based programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language))

- Write a prototype interpreter for a [reactive programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming)

(For those project ideas involving _write a prototype interpreter
for..._ I do not necessarily mean start from scratch --- it is
perfectly okay to start with one of the interpreters we developed and
extend it or modify it.)

If any of these topics interest you, please get in touch with me,
and I can provide some guidance and stuff to read. If you have
another idea for a project, and you would like to discuss it with me
(maybe because you're wondering about the scope of what you want to
do), please get in touch.
