<ul>
<li><p>This project is to be done in teams of 2, or singly. You may discuss problems with fellow students, but all submitted work must be entirely your team's own, and should not be from any other course, present, past, or future. If you use a solution from another source you must cite it â€” this includes when that source is someone else helping you.</p></li>
<li><p>Every source file you submit should begin with a block comment that lists the members of your team, your email addresses, and any remarks that you wish to make to the instructor.</p></li>
<li><p>Projects include a programming component (where you create an artifact) and a final presentation in class during the Final Assessments period. Submission of the programming component should be done by sending source code and any attendant supporting files to <code>olin.submissions@gmail.com</code> by the Final Artifact due date. Only one email per team, please.</p></li>
<li><p>The final presentation should be about fifteen minutes, and describe the problem you're trying to solve and the solution you've implemented, including a demo.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>As a final project for the course, I'm going to ask you to choose a topic related to programming languages that you would like to investigate and that we have not covered in the course, or that we have not covered deep enough for your taste. This can take the form of extending or modifying one of the interpreters or compilers that we developed in the course, or come up with a completely different one.</p>
<p>Here are some possible topics that have come to my mind over the last few weeks. Some of these are things that I thought about talking about in class but ran out of time, others are logical follow-ups to things we've seen, and others are just a completely different take on programming:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Indentation-aware parsing (as in Python)</p></li>
<li><p>Implement an exception system or a <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html">Lisp-like condition system</a></p></li>
<li><p>Implement a debugger with breakpoints for one of our interpreters</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a full object-oriented system (inheritance, class variables, mixins)</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a static type system for objects (with subclassing)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">Type inference</a></p></li>
<li><p>Support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)">array processing in the style of J</a></p></li>
<li><p>Support for matrix processing in the style of Matlab or R (where operations automatically lift to vectors or matrices)</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a subset of a specific programming language the implementation of which you are curious about</p></li>
<li><p>Implement optimizations on our abstract representation such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">constant folding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion">function inlining</a></p></li>
<li><p>Implement something like the Common Lisp <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/loop-for-black-belts.html">loop</a> macro</p></li>
<li><p>Create a tool for automatically producing a lexer and parser given a description of a grammar</p></li>
<li><p>Write a prototype interpreter for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming language</a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a prototype interpreter for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming">probabilistic programming language</a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a prototype interpreter for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">stack-based programming language</a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a prototype interpreter for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming">reactive programming language</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>(For those project ideas involving <em>write a prototype interpreter for...</em> I do not necessarily mean start from scratch --- it is perfectly okay to start with one of the interpreters we developed and extend it or modify it.)</p>
<p>If any of these topics interest you, please get in touch with me, and I can provide some guidance and stuff to read. If you have another idea for a project, and you would like to discuss it with me (maybe because you're wondering about the scope of what you want to do), please get in touch.</p>
