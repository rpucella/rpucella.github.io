    <p>This course explores the notion of computation. We're going to develop
    formal tools for defining what we mean by computation, through
    various forms of automata. We'll develop ways to talk about the
    efficiency of computations, by quantifying their time
    complexity. We will examine alternative models of
    computations, and see how they correspond to different
    programming paradigms.

      <h3>Course Information</h3>

      <p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Discrete Mathematics is no longer a formal prerequisite for FoCS. Prior experience programming will be helpful, since I will not teach programming, as will facility with basic set-theoretic concepts.</p>

      <p><b>Instructor:</b> <a href="http://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (&#x72;&#x69;&#x63;&#x63;&#x61;&#x72;&#x64;&#x6F;&#x2E;&#x70;&#x75;&#x63;&#x65;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x61;&#x40;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#x69;&#x6E;&#x2E;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;)</p>

      <!-- <p><b>Office hours:</b> Thu 15:00-16:00 / MH 353</p> -->

      <p><b>Textbooks:</b> There is no required textbook for the course. We will be working off notes and online references.</p>

      <p>
	There are several excellent books on Theory of Computation
      (the first part of the course), but they are a bit expensive considering that we will 
	be covering only a small part of their content. If you need extra assistance, though, any of these books would be useful:
      <ul>
	<li>Sisper, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/1133187811">Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a></i></li>
	<li>Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Theory-Languages-Computation/dp/0321455363">Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation</a></i></li>
      </ul>
      The library has those two books on reserve. Feel free to go and consult them.
      </p>

      <p>
      An inexpensive and reasonable book is the following, which uses Ruby instead of OCaml:
      <ul>
	<li>Stuart, <i><a href="http://computationbook.com">Understanding Computation</a></i></li>
      </ul>
      It very much follows the spirit of this iteration of FOCS.
      </p>
    
      <p><b>Programming:</b> All programming in this course will be done
      using the programming
      language <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. The OCaml
      interpreter can be downloaded from the web site, and
	supports installations on most common systems. Here are a couple of reasonable books on OCaml that you might
      want to get your hands on if you prefer learning your
      programming language from a book instead of the web:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Hickey, <i><a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf">Introduction
	      to Objective Caml</a></i> (PDF)</li>
	<li>Downey, Monje, <i><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkocaml/">Think
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
	<li>Minsky, Madhavapeddy, Hickey, <i><a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">Real World
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some online resources:</p>
      <ul>

	<li><a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/basics.html">OCaml: The Basics</a> is a very small tutorial giving you the basics of interacting with OCaml.</li>

	<li>Some information on
	  the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/toplevel.html#sec256">commands
	    you can use in the OCaml shell</a>, which can be
	  useful</li>

	<li>The <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/index.html">official
	    OCaml manual</a></li>

	<li>There are no official IDEs for OCaml, but many
	  people swear
	  by <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop"><i>utop</i></a>,
	  which is an OCaml shell replacement. There's also
	  <a href="http://camelia.sourceforge.net/"><i>Camelia</i></a>,
	  but I've never used it. There is
	  an <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/">Eclipse
	    plug-in</a> for OCaml.
	</li>
      </ul>
      

      <p><b>Grading:</b> The final grade is based on weekly homework (70%)
      and two exams (15% each). 
	All work will be done
      individually. Late homeworks will be penalized (10% per 24 hours)
      and no homework will be accepted after its solution has been
      discussed in class.

      <b>Please do not post your code on a public available repository like GitHub. I hate to do this kind of policing, but we've had some issues in the past, and I'd
	like to avoid a repeat if possible.</b>


      <p><b>Ninjas:</b> We have a ninja for the class: Joe Sutker (<tt>Joseph.Sutker</tt> at the usual <tt>students</tt>.<tt>olin</tt>.<tt>edu</tt>). His office hours will be posted here when they are determined.</p>

	    <p><a href="02-automata.pdf">Notes from the lecture.</a></p>
	    <p>The notes include some supplementary material at the
	    end, fleshing out things that I think are pretty
	    interesting: (1) I show how the language accepted by a
	    finite automaton must be regular; (2) I point out how you
	    can use finite automata to show that the complement of
	    a regular language is regular; (3) I show how you can use finite automata to 
            argue that some languages are not regular.</p>
	    <p>I pointed out in class one reason we study
nondeterministic forms of finite automata is that they can be easier
to describe than deterministic finite automata. More specifically,
there exists languages that can be accepted by nondeterministic finite
automata with N states whose smallest deterministic finite
	      automata that accept those same languages have at least 2<sup>N</sup> states. One example is the language over {<tt>a</tt>,<tt>b</tt>} 
	      consisting of all strings whose Nth from last symbol is <tt>a</tt>. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NFA_with_exponential_blown-up_DFA.gif">Here is an illustration</a> of the subset construction for that language, over alphabet {0,1}, and N=4.</p>

	    <p><a href="03-turing.pdf">Notes from the lecture.</a> Note that these include a description of a version of Turing machines with more than one tape, and an argument for why those don't let you accept more languages than single-tape Turing machines. We'll come back to that next lecture.

	    <p>I mentioned that there were machines that were more expressive than finite automata but less expressive than Turing machines. One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton">pushdown automata</a>, which are finite automata equipped with a stack.

	  <p>The main area of CS where you'll encounter grammars is
