      <h1>Databases (Spring 2025)</h1>

      <p>This is an introduction to database systems. Topics covered
        include: the relational model, SQL-based querying,
        transactions, data structures, as well non-relational database
        models. The approach will be hands-on: while we will practice
        on existing database systems, we will also write code to
        implement simplified versions of the various database models
        and their query systems.
      </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Lemahieu, Baesens, Broucke, <i><a href="https://www.pdbmbook.com/">Principles of Database Management</a></i>, Cambridge University Press, 2018.

            If you want other reference material, the following are also good references:

          </li>

      <li><b>Programming:</b> All programming in this course will be done using the programming
        language <a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank">Go</a>. It's a lowish-level, statically-typed, compiled language available on all platforms. Straightforward to <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install">install</a>. You will need a text editor. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a> seems to have <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go" target="_blank">reasonable integration with Go</a>.

        <p>Take <a href="https://go.dev/tour/list">A Tour of Go</a> as a first step. It's a lightning quick intro to the language.</p>

        <p>Most of the Go resources are online. When googling, use "Golang" since "Go" is a terrible SEO keyword. A book I've enjoyed if you prefer learning from books is:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Donovan, Kernighan, <i><a href="https://www.gopl.io/" target="_blank">The Go Programming Language</a></i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that the book covers a slightly older version of the language, pre-dating the new version of the module system. This won't matter for us since we're not going to build large software, but it's good to keep in mind.</p>

        <!-- Online resources -->

      <li><b>Grading:</b> The final grade is based on biweekly homeworks (60%) and a final
        project (40%). All homeworks except the first is to be done in teams of two.
        Late homeworks will be penalized (20% per day) and no homework will be accepted after
        its solution has been discussed in class. Please do not post your homework code on a
          publicly available repository like GitHub during the course.</li>

          <li>I expect all of us to follow the <b><a href="https://www.olin.edu/student-life-student-affairs-and-resources/student-rights-responsibilities">Olin Honor Code</a></b>.</li>

          <p>The Go <a href="./demo.go">demo code</a> I showed in class, annotated. Please have a read-through. To run the code, you can use <pre>    go run demo.go</pre> from the command-line in the directory in which you stored <tt>demo.go</tt>. Alternatively, you can also compile the code with <pre>    go build demo.go</pre> which should create an executable <tt>demo</tt> in the directory and which you can run in the usual way, <tt>./demo</tt>. If you use an IDE, investigate how you can run and/or compile Go code.</p>

          <p>Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD operations</a>.</p>

          <p>What I called "arrays with capacity" in the slides are sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array">dynamic arrays</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Wikipedia links for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> and for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary search trees</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">AVL trees</a> are one of the simplest form of balanced trees. Here's a <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html">cute visualization</a> of what happens when you insert
	    into an AVL tree. Try starting with the empty tree, and
	    inserting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... You'll see the tree
	      grow "to the right" and then rebalance itself repeatedly.</p>

          <p>Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash functions</a>, which
            provides a good overview of various kind of hash functions. Note that the hash function I mentioned
            in class using the mod operation is an instance of division hashing.</p>

          <p>A way to resolve collisions in a hash table is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing">linear probing</a> to find a free cell when the cell that a hash function targets is already occupied by another item than the one we're trying to insert.</p>

          <p>Wikipedia on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model">The Relational Model</a>.</p>

          <p>The <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf">original paper</a> of Codd on the relational model, which is of historic interest. Also interesting is Codd's <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358396.358400">1981 Turing Award lecture</a>.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> is a small relational database engine that stores data in a single file and can be accessed programmatically from many programming languages. It's useful in its own right, but it's great for learning about the basics of relational data. It is also generally installed by default on Linux and MacOS installations. Try typing <tt>sqlite3</tt> from a terminal.</p>

         <p>The <a href="./books.sql">sample SQLite file</a> I demoed in class containing the DDL code for setting up the simple books table I used as a running example. Here's a <a href="./books.txt">sample interaction</a> with SQLite from my MacOS terminal, with <tt>#</tt> as my shell prompt.</p>

      <li><p><span class="hdr">Feb 24: </span><b>SQL (Structured Query Language)</b></p>

	      <p>A draft of the <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt">1992 standard</a>, if you like reading those sort of documents.</p>

	      <p>There are tons of tutorials on SQL online, usually tied to a particular database implementation, since you can't use SQL "in the abstract". I've used <a href="http://www.postgresqltutorial.com">Postgres's SQL tutorial</a> in the past to introduce SQL to colleagues (start with Section 2). An interactive tutorial that I greatly enjoy is <a href="https://sqlbolt.com/">SQLBolt</a>.</p>

              <p>Two SQL features we did not cover in class but you may run into are <a href="https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-views/">views</a> (which are a form of live query that looks like a table in the database) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure">stored procedures</a> (which are a form of functions that can be written directly into the database). Views tend to look the same across relational databases, while stored procedures are much more vendor dependent.</p>

      <li><p><span class="hdr">Mar 3: </span><b>Programming APIs and ORMs </b></p>
        <div class="lect">

           <p>Reading: Textbook, Chapter 6.2 (normalization) and Chapter 15 (Programming APIs).</p>
           
           <p>A reasonable set of slides on <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4320/2008fa/slides/20081114_fds.pdf">normalizations and functional dependencies</a>. It goes into a more details than I covered, including decomposition.</p>

           <p>The <a href="./database-apis.zip">sample code</a> I demo-ed in class, a simple flask-based web application server that navigates the simple SQLite books database we have been using to study SQL. Unzip the file, go into the <tt>database-apis/</tt> folder that gets created, and look at the <tt>README.md</tt> file to run the code. It requires Python 3.</p>

	   <p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html">JDBC</a> is the Java API for connecting to databases. Most databases have JDBC drivers that support that API. It has become a de facto standard, and many other languages use that same API to provide database connectivity.</p>
	      
           <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORMs</a> (Object-Relational Mappings) are a more abstract  way to provide an interface to a database through a programming language: ORMs reify database tables as data structures in the language, so that modifying the structures will automatically update the underlying tables, and changes to the underlying tables will be visible through the structures. <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> is a popular Python ORM, while <a href="https://gorm.io/">GORM</a> is one you can use in Go.</p>

           <p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/">LINQ</a> is one approach to integrate SQL-style querying within a programming language (here, C#).</p>

          <p>Reading: Textbook, Chapter 12</p>

          <p><a href="./notes/physical-model-indexing.pdf">Slides</a> from the lecture.</p>

          <p>Overviews of physical storage and indexing tend to be hefty because there are so many axes across which to compare the various approaches. A reasonable writeup (which provides a compatible alternative to the textbook) is this <a href="https://ieda.ust.hk/dfaculty/ajay/courses/ielm230/lecs/lec6_indexes.pdf">set of lecture notes</a>.</p>

	  <p>Wikipedia pages on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+ trees</a>, the data structure I showed for managing indexes on block-based storage systems (like disks). They're a variant of the earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B trees</a> which allow internal nodes to also store records.</p>
