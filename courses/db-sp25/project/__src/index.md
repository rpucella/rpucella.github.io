# Final Project

## Final Presentations: Wednesday, May 7, 2025 (4-7pm, MAC 126)

## Deliverables Due: Sunday, May 11, 2025 (11:59pm)

Think of the final project as an open-ended last homework with an associated short presentation.

The task: 

- Create teams (two students)
- Pick a topic - something about databases that we haven't covered in class and that you are curious
  about. The ideal project has you understanding the topic and how it connects to what we've seen in
  class, and implement a prototype or create a demonstration. 
- Confirm the topic with your instructor (huh, me).

Deliverables:

- A 10-15 minutes presentation during final events period
- A github repo with the code for your implementation and a detailed README with:
    - a description of the work
    - the most interesting challenges you encountered
    - how to bundle and run the code

Possible topics, if you can't think of any:

- SQL [query evaluation](https://www.csbio.unc.edu/mcmillan/Media/Comp521F10Lecture16.pdf) and [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_optimization) via query plans.
- [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) query evaluation.
- [Statistical databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_database) and differential privacy.

- [XML databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_database) and querying XML data (via [XQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery) or similar).
- [SQL security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)
- [OLAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing) and Business Intelligence
- [Apache Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark)
