    <p class="subtitle">Topic Proposals Due Date: Wed, Apr 4, 2018<br>
    Final Presentations: TBD (but during Final events week) <!-- Tuesday, Dec 13, 2016 (4-7pm, AC326) --><br>
    Final Code Due Date: TBD</p>

    <p><b>Note on integrity:</b> The project is meant to be done in
      <b>teams of 2</b>. You may discuss problems with fellow students, but all
    work must be entirely that of your team, and should not be from
    any other course, present, past, or future. If you use a solution
    from another source you must cite it &mdash; this includes when
    that source is someone else helping you.</b>
   </p>

    <p>Every source file you submit should begin with a block comment
      that lists <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the members of your team</span>, your <span style="text-decoration:underline;">email addresses</span>, and any <span style="text-decoration:underline;">remarks</span> that you
      wish to make to the instructor.</p>

    <p>Projects include a programming component (where you create an
    artifact) and a final presentation in class during the Final Assessments
    period. Submission of the programming component should be done by
    sending source code and any attendant supporting files
    to <tt>olin.submissions@gmail.com</tt> by the Final Code due date. Only one email per team, please.</p>

    <p>The final presentation should be about fifteen minutes, and
    describe the problem you're trying to solve and the solution
      you've implemented, including a demo.</p>

    <hr>

<p>As a final project for the course, I'm going to ask you to choose a
  topic related to programming languages that you would like to
  investigate and that we have not covered in the course, or that we
  have not covered deep enough for your taste. This can take the form
  of extending or modifying one of the interpreters or compilers that
  we developed in the course, or come up with a completely different
  one.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some possible topics that have come to my mind over the
  last few weeks. Some of these are things that I thought about
  talking about in class but ran out of time, others are logical
  follow-ups to things we've seen, and others are just a completely
  different take on programming:</p>

<ul>
  
    <li>Indentation-aware parsing (as in Python)</li>

    <li>Implement an exception system</li>

    <li>Implement a debugger with breakpoints for one of our interpreters</li>

    <li>Implement a static type system for objects</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">Type inference</a></li>

    <li>Add mixins to our object system</li>

    <li>Support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)">array
	processing in the style of J</a></li>
    
    <li>Support for matrix processing in the stle of Matlab or R (where
      operations automatically lift to vectors or matrices)</li>

    <li>Implement a subset of a specific programming
      language the implementation of which you are curious about</li>

    <li>Implement optimizations on our abstract representation such
      as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">constant
      folding</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion">function
      inlining</a></li>

    <li>Create a tool for automatically producing a lexer and parser given a description of a grammar</li>

    <li>Write a prototype interpreter for
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming language</a></li>

    <li>Write a prototype interpreter for a <a href="http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home">probabilistic
	programming language</a></li>

    <li>Write a prototype interpreter for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">stack-based programming langauge</a></li>

    <li>Write a prototype interpreter for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming">reactive programming language</a></li>

</ul>

<p>(For those project ideas involving <q>write a prototype interpreter for...</q> I do not necessarily mean start from scratch &mdash; it is perfectly okay to start with one of the interpreters we developed and extend it or modify it.)</p>

<p>
  If any of these topics interest you, please get in touch with me,
  and I can provide some guidance and stuff to read. If you have
  another idea for a project, and you would like to discuss it with me
  (maybe because you're wondering about the scope of what you want to
  do), please get in touch.</p>
