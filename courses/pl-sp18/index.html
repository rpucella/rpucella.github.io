    <p class="subtitle">ENGR 3599 / Thursday 1:30-4:00 PM / AC 128 </p>
    
    <p>This course is an introduction to the theory, design, and
    implementation of programming languages. Topics covered may
    include: semantics of programming languages, types, higher-order
    functions and lambda calculus, objects, laziness, continuations,
    monads, objects, and concurrency. Class work revolves around the
    implementation of interpreters for a variety of small programming
    languages.</p>

	you'd like to do. If you have no idea, please get in touch
	with me before then and we'll figure something out for you to

	and afterward we'll dip our toes into compilation.</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdr">Mar 10:</span> I have
	simplified the C-style mutable state implementation that I
	presented in lecture. Recall that in lecture, I presented a
	syntactic transformation that transformed every application
	into one that first wrapped every argument into a reference
	cell before performing the application. This required
	primitive operations in the top-level environment to be wrapped with a function that pulled
	out the values in the reference cells before calling the
	underlying primitive operations, since primitive operations
	    are passed values. The new implementation keeps the original
	    function application, keeps the original primitive
	    operations, and only changes how the surface syntax
	for <tt>fun</tt> is parsed. There is now a syntactic
	    transformation that transforms a <tt>fun</tt> into
	one that first wraps all of its arguments with reference cells
	before evaluating the body. I have changed the slides
	    accordingly, so you should be able to follow what's going
	    on there.</p></li>

	<li><p class="ann"><span class="hdw">Feb 28:</span> I
	mentioned in class that the core of FUNC (the language with
	single-argument functions) is basically
	    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda
	calculus</a>. The main practical consequence is that we
	basically get for free the encoding capabilities of the lambda
	calculus. Example 1: we don't actually need recursive
	functions&mdash;we can implement recursion. Here is factorial
	    the way we can write it in the language from the homework, which allows recursive functions:<br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;<tt> (fun f (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))</tt><br>
	    But it turns out we can also write it as follows:<br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;<tt> (Z (fun (f) (fun (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))))</tt><br>
	    where <tt>Z</tt> is a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator">fixed-point combinator</a></i> defined as follows:<br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;<tt> (fun (f) ((fun (x) (f (fun (v) ((x x) v)))) (fun (x) (f (fun (v) ((x x) v))))))</tt><br>
	    That looks slightly mysterious, I grant you that. But it works. </p></li>

      <h3>Course Information</h3>

      <p>Prerequisites: ENGR 2510</p>

      <p>Instructor: <a href="http://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (<a id="send_email" href="#">send email</a>)</p>

      <p>Office hours: Thu 4:00-5:00pm / MH 353</p> <!-- Tue 15:00-16:00 / MH 353</p> -->

      <p>Textbook: We don't have a textbook. There is nothing out
      there that captures quite what I want to do in this course. I
      will find readings for us to supplement the lectures. 

      If you're looking for reference books that cover some of the
     topics we'll cover, the following might help:
      <ul>
	<li>
         <i><a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/">Programming
	Languages: Application and Interpretation</a></i> by Shriram Krishnamurthy. This is the
	closest book in spirit to what I want to cover in the
	course. It is freely available online. It uses Racket, a
	dialect of Scheme. Definitely worth a read.</li>
      </ul>

      <!--
	<li>Glynn
	Winskell, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Formal-Semantics-Programming-Languages-Winskel/dp/0262731037">Formal
	Semantics of Programming Languages</a></i>. This book specifically
	covers formal semantics, and not implementation, so it looks pretty remove from what we're taThere are
	many excellent textbooks on semantics that have been
	published in the last few years. This one is a bit older, but
	it's a classic, and you should be able to find good used
	copies.</li> -->
	
      <p>Programming: All programming in the course will be done in
	<a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> (version 2.12, though that shouldn't matter an awful lot).
	I will not expect you to know how to program in Scala, but you should have good working knowledge of Python, especially its object model. . We'll pick up Scala proper as we go along. A good reference manual is:

      <ul>
	<li><i><a href="https://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_3ed">Programming in Scala</a> 3rd edition</i> by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners. The first edition is <a href="http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/">available online</a>, if you want to check it out. (The core language hasn't changed that much, but I'm not sure how much the first edition carries over when you get to more advanced topics.)</li>
      </ul>

      You can get Scala
      from the <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/download/">official download page</a>. Note that
      if you install Scala on Windows, you'll probably want to install
      the Scala binaries instead of using <tt>sbt</tt> so that you
      have easy access to the interactive compiler. (The Scala build
      tool <tt>sbt</tt> is great, but pretty much overkill for what
      we're going to do, at least at first.) Scala can be installed
      from Homebrew on Mac OS X. The appropriate .tgz is available for
      Linux</p>

      <p>Grading: The final grade is based on weekly homeworks for the
      first five weeks (40%), biweekly homeworks for the following four
      weeks (30%), and a final project (30%). All work to be done in
      teams of two. Late homeworks will be penalized (10% per 24 hours)
      and no homework will be accepted after its solution has been
	discussed in class.</p>

    <p>Ninja: Lucy Wilcox. Office hours in the library: Tuesday 1-2pm, Wednesday 7-9pm. (Sometimes: Sunday 7-9pm &mdash; an email will be sent when she's available then.)</p>

<p>I expect all of us to follow the <b><a href="http://www.olin.edu/academic-life/student-affairs-resources/student-life/honor-code/">Olin Honor Code</a></b>.</p>

	    <p>We are going to use the <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators">Scala Standard Parser Combinator Library</a> as our parsing library in Scala. You should be able to access it by writing <tt>import scala.util.parsing.combinator._</tt> in your scala code. For an in-depth example that uses parser combinators, have a look at <a href="http://enear.github.io/2016/03/31/parser-combinators/">this</a>, but note that it uses concepts from Scala we have not introduced yet.</p>

	    <p>If you're interested in some of the theory underlying parser combinators, a good starting point is Graham Hutton's <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/parsing.pdf"><i>Higher-Order Functions for Parsing</i></a> tutorial.</p>

	  <div class="lect">

	    <p><a href="./lect-04-functions.pdf">Slides from the lecture.</a></p>

	    <p>Sample code from the lecture: <a href="./code-lect-04-dynamic.scala">functions with dynamic binding</a>, <a href="./code-lect-04-static.scala">functions with static binding</a>.</p>

	    <p>A good overview of some advantages of the functional programming approach is given by John Hughes' <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html"><i>Why Functional Programming Matters.</i></a> The first three sections at least should be pretty accessible.</p>
	    
	    <p>A very short description of the <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/03wi/imperative/scoping.html">difference between static binding and dynamic binding</a> (here, and in many places, called static/lexical scoping and dynamic scoping)</p>

	    <p>Here is an example different than the one I used in class that shows the difference between static and dynamic binding. Python has static binding. Here is a simple example in Python that won't be a surprise to anyone:
	      <pre>
  v = 10
  
  def f () :
    return v
  
  def g () :
    v = 2000
    return f()
  
  print g()</pre>
	      If you run this code, value <tt>10</tt> will get printed. The declaration <tt>v = 2000</tt> in <tt>g</tt> is a local declaration (you would have to say <tt>global v</tt> otherwise), and <span class="underline">of course</span> the <tt>v</tt> in <tt>f</tt> refers to the global <tt>v</tt>. So calling <tt>f()</tt> from <tt>g</tt> returns 10, as expected. But the only reason why you say <span class="underline">of course</span> above is because you drank the static-binding Koolaid. If you write the equivalent of the above code in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp">Emacs Lisp</a> which uses dynamic binding, things are quite different:
	      <pre>
  (defconst v 10)
  
  (defun f () v)
  
  (defun g () (let ((v 2000)) (f)))
  
  (g)</pre>
	      Lo and behold, you get value <tt>2000</tt>. The local binding of <tt>v</tt> in <tt>g</tt> supercedes the global binding of <tt>v</tt> when calling <tt>f</tt> from <tt>g</tt>, against all intuition. The global constant <tt>v</tt> always has value <tt>10</tt> &mdash; that never changed. What changes is what <tt>v</tt> the <tt>v</tt> in <tt>f</tt> refers to. When it's called from <tt>g</tt>, it refers to the <tt>v</tt> in <tt>g</tt>, not the global <tt>v</tt>. Yeah, I know... Welcome to dynamic binding!</p>
	      	      
	    
	    <p>If you're into it, you can read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funarg_problem">upward funarg problem</a> that motivated the invention of closures. It gets deep in the guts of language implementation using a stack <i>&agrave; la</i> C, though, so be warned.</p>

	<li><p><span class="hdr">Feb 22:</span><b>Parser Transformations</b></p>
	  <div class="lect">
	    
	    <p><a href="./code-lect-05.scala">Sample code from the lecture</a>.</p>
	    
	    <p>The idea that we can keep the abstract representation
	    simple while still allowing an extensive surface syntax by
	    using the "trick" of parsing some of the surface syntax
	    into a complex abstract representation is widespread. For
	    instance, the surface syntax <tt>(and x y z)</tt> can
	    parse into
	    roughly <tt>EIf(x,EIf(y,z,false),false)</tt>. In other
	    words, we don't need to introduce abstract representation
	    for everything in the surface
	    syntax. In <a href="#">Homework 4</a>, we
	    use this idea to introduce vector comprehension, a
	    convenient syntax for expression <tt>map</tt>
	    and <tt>filter</tt> over vectors.</p> 
 
	    <p>Some languages actually let users define their own surface syntax
	      transformations. Macros
	      in <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/R4RS/r4rs_12.html">Scheme</a>
	      and
	      in <a href="https://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/book/macros.html">Rust</a>
	      do exactly that: they allow transformations to be
	      expressed <i>within the language</i>, and their parser
	      can look up those transformations while parsing, instead
	      of requiring the transformations to be hard-wired into
	      the parser. Same process, slightly more flexible
	      approach. (There's a cost to that approach: the parser
	      needs to be more complex because it needs to look up
	      applicable transformations at suitable points. It might
	      be a very nice project to figure out ways of doing just
  that.)</p>

<p>I mentioned that the core of FUNC (our little language with
  single-argument functions) is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda
  Calculus</a>.</p>

		  <p>A quick overview of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">difference between inheritance and composition</a> (which I called delegation) &mdash; in some languages, both are ways to get a subclassing relationship between classes.</p>
		  <p>Some additional sample code, extending our <a href="code-lect-07-inheritance.scala">object system with inheritance</a>. My changes are marked with a comment <tt>INHERITANCE</tt> That turned out to be easier than expected, given how we built up our objects. Objects now take an extra parameter, a super object (that is, an object of the class from which the class is inheriting). In the surface syntax, <tt>class</tt> takes an extra (optional parameter) after its parameters, namely a call to a class constructor to indicate what class the current class is inheriting from. That constructor call is passed <tt>EObject</tt> which uses it to construct an object of that class from which the object is inheriting. That super object is stored in the <tt>VObject</tt> value. When you look up a field or method in a <tt>VObject</tt> and it's not found in the object, the field or method is looked up in the super object. If found, it is returned. We get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">dynamic dispatch</a> essentially for free because when a method is returned, it is wrapped with a <tt>(fun (this) ...)</tt> whether it came from the object or the super object. That function is always invoked with the object on which the method is invoked, therefore <tt>this</tt> is always bound to the current object. </p>

<!--	    <p>At the end of lecture, I mentioned the problem of
	    giving a reasonable type to reference cells. The sample
	    code types function <tt>ref</tt> as <tt>(-> ((int)) (ref
	    int))</tt>, and therefore will only work to create integer
	    reference cells. There is no way, say, to create a Boolean
	    referenece cells. A more general type for reference cells
	    uses <i>type variables</i> to give
	    a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">generic
	    type</a></i> to <tt>ref</tt>, along the lines of <tt>(->
  ((a)) (ref a))</tt>. The modifications necessary to the type
checker are not extensive, except for the case of <tt>ECall</tt>,
which
	    requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)">unification</a>
	    in order to figure out the types to assign to the type
	    variables to obtain the result type of the call. (I may
	    provide some sample code in the future for this, or it can
	    be a final project.) Type systems with generics are known
	    as polymorphic type systems.
	    </p>
-->
	    <p>
	      Towards the end of the lecture, we
  discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric
  polymorphism</a> as a way to extend the type system to type more
	      expressions.</p>

	    <p>Even more advanced type systems can be obtained by
  using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type">dependent
  types</a>, which allow types to depend on values! Thus, you can
  write not only the type of lists over a type A, but you can also
  write a type <tt>(list n A)</tt> for lists of length <i>n</i> over a
  type A, where <i>n</i> is a value in the language. Using such a type
	      system, we can type a concatenate function on lists with a function type taking arguments
	      <tt>(list n A)</tt> and <tt>(list m A)</tt> with a return type <tt>(list (+ m n) A)</tt>. These type systems have a pretty complex type-checking algorithm.</p>

		  <p>Sample code from the lecture: <a href="code-lect-12-amb.scala">an implementation of amb</a>. Note that most of the code is implemented as primitives in the standard environment coded directly in the abstract representation.</p>
		  <p>The basis of the implementation of <tt>amb</tt> in the sample code is from an overview of the <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/programming-with-continuations--exceptions-backtracking-search-threads-generators-coroutines/">use of continuations to implement non-local control structures</a> by Matthew Might.</p>
		  <p>I mentioned in class that we can use continuations to implement coroutines, which are a cooperative form of multithreading. (A coroutine explicitly cedes control to another.) The paper <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/ftp/techreports/TR158.pdf">Continuations and Coroutines</a> by Haynes, Friedman, and Wand describe how that can be done. It is technical, but readable.</p>
		  <p>Once you get how to implement coroutines with continuations, you are pretty close to being able to implement a preemptive multithreading system, where you can spawn threads and the runtime system is in charge of switching from one to the other at regular short intervals. The implementation of the programming language <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Concurrent-Programming-ML-John-Reppy/dp/0521714729">Concurrent
		ML</a> is based on exactly this idea.</p>
