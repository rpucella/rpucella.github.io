    <h1>The 1066 Conquest of England</h1>

    <p>
      The conquest of England in 1066 was a pivotal event in British history. It began when
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror">William, Duke of Normandy</a>,
      invaded England with a Norman army, aiming to claim the English throne. The conquest was
      triggered by the death of the childless
      King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> and
      a dispute over his successor. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Godwinson">Harold
      Godwinson</a>, an English noble, was crowned king, but William disputed his claim and launched
      an invasion. The conquest culminated in the famous Battle of Hastings, where Harold's army was
      defeated, and William emerged as the victorious conqueror.

    <p>The Battle of Hastings, fought on October 14, 1066, was a turning point in the conquest of
    England. Harold's forces fought valiantly, but William's well-organized and disciplined Norman
    army proved superior. The battle was characterized by its ferocity and intensity, with both
    sides sustaining heavy casualties. Harold himself was killed, struck by an arrow in the eye, and
    his death sealed the fate of the English resistance. Following the battle, William was crowned
    King of England on Christmas Day, solidifying his conquest and establishing Norman rule over the
    country.</p>

    <p>The Norman Conquest had a profound impact on England. It brought about significant political,
    social, and cultural changes. William introduced a centralized and feudal system of governance,
    replacing the previous Anglo-Saxon system. Norman nobles were granted vast estates, leading to
    the integration of Norman and Anglo-Saxon aristocracy. The English language also experienced a
    significant influence from French, as the Normans became the ruling elite. The conquest had
    long-lasting effects, shaping the course of English history and contributing to the development
      of the English nation.</p>
