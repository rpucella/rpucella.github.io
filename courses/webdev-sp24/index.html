  <h1>Full-Stack Web Development (Spring 2024)</h1>
  
  <p>
    An intensive introduction to the full stack of modern web
    development, including HTML and CSS, JavaScript, client-side
    frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, ...), server-side templates,
    server-side frameworks (Flask, Express, ...), authentication,
    persistence, REST APIs, and websockets.

    <h2>Course Information</h2>

    <ul class="plain">

      <li><b>Course number:</b> ENGR 3599</li>

      <li><b>Prerequisites:</b> Software Design. I'm expecting that you know how to program at least in Python.</li>

      <li><b>Location and Time:</b>
        MAC 328 <del>MAC 126</del> / Tue 6-8:40pm
      </li>


      <li><b>Instructor:</b> <a href="https://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (&#x72;&#x69;&#x63;&#x63;&#x61;&#x72;&#x64;&#x6F;&#x2E;&#x70;&#x75;&#x63;&#x65;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x61;&#x40;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#x69;&#x6E;&#x2E;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;)
      </li>

      <li><b>Office hours:</b> MH 353 / Tue 4-5pm (before class) / I'm also available at other times over Zoom by request, just contact me
      </li>

      <li><b>Textbooks:</b> There is no required textbook. We'll mostly be using freely available resources, or documents I will share with you. If you truly want a textbook, the following is a reasonably broad overview of the field as it existed a decade ago, going into a lot of details about the basics, which haven't changed that much since then anyway.

        <ul>
          <li>Sebasta, <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Sebesta-Programming-the-World-Wide-Web-8th-Edition/PGM30365.html"><i>Programming the World Wide Web</i></a>, Pearson. 2015</li>
        </ul>

        Generally speaking, the technology evolves way too quickly for any good book to be up-to-date with what's currently available out there. Still, the above generally sticks to foundational topics that remains true.
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Grading</b> Weekly or bi-weekly homeworks (60% of final grade) and a final project and
        presentation (40% of final grade).  All work done in teams of 2. Late work will be penalized
        (10% per 24 hours) and no work will be accepted after its solution has been discussed in
        class. You have a bank of 3 "hall pass" days &mdash; each of which giving a 1-day extension
        on the homework &mdash; that you can apply to any homework. You can use those days on a
        single homework, or multiple homeworks.

        <b>Please do not post your homework code on a publicly available repository like
          GitHub.</b>
      </li>
      
      <li><b>Course Assistants:</b> TBD.</li>
      
      <li><b>Chat server:</b> Announcements and discussions take place on <a href="https://chat.rpucella.net/webdev-sp24" target="_blank">our chat server</a>, which double as our homework submission server. You should have received account information by email. If not, please reach out.
      </li>

      <li><b>Honor code:</b> I expect all of us to follow the <a href="https://www.olin.edu/student-life-student-affairs-and-resources/student-rights-responsibilities">Olin Honor Code</a>.

            <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>, formerly the Mozilla

                  the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_mode">layout</a>; the
              basic rendering algorithm with block and inline element I alluded to in class is

            <p>
              This article describes
              the <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/">process
                of turning a web document into a rendered page</a> in overwhelming detail. Note that
              it also takes styling into account.

              You will want to become familiar with your browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools">Developer Tools</a>, which provide you with a way to access the DOM visually, and see what your browser sees on the page and interact with it. Every browser has them. The above info is for Firefox, but you have them for <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools">Safari</a> as well.

	    <p>A complete version of the <a href="demos/css/index.html">HTML code</a> we worked on in class. You can look at the code by using your browser's <b>View Source</b> option. (Find it for your browser.) You'll see some changes from what we've done, including adding links, a fixed footer, and a fun slanted title with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transforms"><tt>transform</tt> property</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">MDN CSS</a> pages that describe pretty much everything you need to know.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance">cascade</a> part of CCS.</p>

            <p>CSS rules are defined using selectors. There is a pretty involved <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors">language of selectors</a> that you can use in rules.</p>

            <p>Which CSS rule applies when multiple rules affect an element depends on the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/">specificity of the rules involved</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">Pseudo-classes</a> are a way to define rules to apply to certain elements in certain states.</p>

            <p>Distinctions between <a href="https://www.samanthaming.com/pictorials/css-inline-vs-inlineblock-vs-block/"><code>inline</code>, <code>inline-block</code>, and <code>block</code></a> for the <code>display</code> property.</p>

	    <p>The two "rules of design" that I alluded to in class: <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-2
">The 8 point grid system</a>, and <a href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">Never use black</a>. Your mileage will vary, obviously, but they are effective rules to keep in mind.</p>
