    <h1>Notes on Model-View-Controller Architecture (MVC)</h1>

<p>Javascript is used to</p>

<ul>
<li>attach actions to events</li>
<li>modify the DOM as the result of those actions</li>
</ul>

<p>Writing a UI by simply attaching actions to events with no structure does not scale</p>

<ul>
<li>the flow of control is all over the place</li>
<li>the logic ends up in the various event handlers</li>
<li>in homework 2, for instance, the logic is in the click handler for a card</li>
</ul>

<p>For any non-trivial UI where we have many controls that come and go and therefore many event
handlers that are all always primed at the same time, the logic ends up spread out across all the
handlers in a way that makes it:</p>

<ul>
<li>hard to make changes - &quot;I want to change X, where do I find where X is done?&quot;</li>
<li>easy to miss or forget something when doing an update</li>
<li>difficult to recognize what is the state of the application at any point in time</li>
</ul>

<p>Many approaches have been developed over the years to make it more manageable to write UIs with event handlers.</p>

<ul>
<li>many evolve from the so-called MVC architecture developed for SmallTalk</li>
</ul>

<p><img style="width: 600px; padding: 10px;" src="mvc.png"></p>

<p>MVC stands for <em>Model-View-Controller</em>, describing the three components to this architecture</p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>model</strong>, which holds the state of the application, and defines actions that can be used to
update the model</li>
<li>the <strong>view</strong>, which reflect the model to the user on the screen</li>
<li>the <strong>controller</strong>, which handles user input and transforms those inputs into actions on the model</li>
</ul>

<p>How this gets instantiated in different applications depends on both the application being
developped and the programming language being used. For instance, whether the view or the controller
is a single object or multiple objects depends on application and language.</p>

<p>The controller calls the model using the actions that the model provides. So the controller need to
know about the model. In most uses of MVC, the model doesn't know about the controller or the
view. It provides actions for the controller to imvoke. But how does the view know when to update
itself to reflect model changes? How does the model tell the view to update if the model doesn't
know anything about the view?</p>

<h2>Publisher-Subscriber Pattern</h2>

<p>The model and the view are in a Publisher-Subscriber relation. Publisher-Subscriber is a way to
structure code (a so-called <em>design pattern</em>) when you have part of the system creating values (the
<em>publisher</em>) that other parts of the system are interested in using (the <em>subscribers</em>), and when
you do not want to hard-code into the publisher which subscribers should get the values created. In
a Publisher-Subscriber pattern, the publisher has a way to notify subscribers that a new value has
been created, and subscriber can dynamically <em>subscribe</em> (and potentially unsubscribe) to these
notifications during program execution.</p>

<p>Here's how to implement a simple Publisher-Subscriber pattern in Python:</p>

<pre><code>class Publisher:

    def __init__(self):
        self._subscribers = {}

    def publish(self, channel, v):
        if channel in self._subscribers:
            for m in self._subscribers[channel]:
                m(v)

    def subscribe(self, channel, f):
        if channel in self._subscribers:
            self._subscribers[channel].append(f)

    def channel(self, channel):
        self._subscribers[channel] = []


class Subscriber:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    def receiveApples(self, v):
        print(f&quot;{self._name} received apples value {v}&quot;)

    def receiveOranges(self, v):
        print(f&quot;{self._name} received oranges value {v}&quot;)


def setup():
    # Create publisher.
    p = Publisher()
    # Create channels on the publisher.
    p.channel('apples')
    p.channel('oranges')
    # Create subscribers.
    alice = Subscriber('Alice')
    bob = Subscriber('Bob')
    charlie = Subscriber('Charlie')
    # Subscribe to publisher.
    p.subscribe('apples', alice.receiveApples)
    p.subscribe('oranges', bob.receiveOranges)
    p.subscribe('apples', charlie.receiveApples)
    p.subscribe('oranges', charlie.receiveOranges)
    return p

def test():
    p = setup()
    # Test:
    print('------------------------------------------------------------')
    p.publish('apples', 66)
    print('------------------------------------------------------------')
    p.publish('oranges', 99)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using Python here just to show that Publisher-Subscribe is not Javascript-specific.</p>
