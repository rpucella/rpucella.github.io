<h1>Final Project</h1>

<h2>Final Presentations: Thursday, May 2, 2024 (4pm-7pm, MH 126)</h2>

<h2>Deliverables Due: Sunday, May 5, 2024 (11pm)</h2>

<p>Think of the final project as an open-ended last homework with an associated short presentation.</p>

<p>The task:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create teams of 2</li>
<li>Pick a topic - a web app or a website, with some nontrivial functionality; ideally, there'd be a web application server component as well, but that is not strictly required if you have enough &quot;juice&quot; in your frontend</li>
<li>Once you've selected a topic, reach out to me, and I'll give you some references and technical guidance if relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>Deliverables:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 10-15 minutes presentation during final events period</li>
<li>A github repo with the code for your implementation and a detailed README with:

<ul>
<li>a description of the work</li>
<li>the most interesting challenges you encountered</li>
<li>how to bundle and run the code</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Possible topics, if you can't think of any:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extend the memory game to be a 2 players game (players taking turns playing, playing again when they have a match, the winner being whomever flips the last two cards)</li>
<li>Extend the picture viewer from class to allow for downloading images and storing them on the server (instead of hot-linking them), and implementing authentication and allowing users to leave comments on pictures</li>
<li>Extend our classchat in some way (reactions, or allowing the posting of pictures, etc). The repo is <a href="https://github.com/rpucella/Class-Chat">here</a> but you'll probably need to reach out to me for installation instructions</li>
</ul>
