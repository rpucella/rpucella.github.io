# Final Project

## Final Presentations: Thursday, May 2, 2024 (4pm-7pm, MAC 328 <del>MAC 126</del> )

## Deliverables Due: Sunday, May 5, 2024 (11pm)

Think of the final project as an open-ended last homework with an associated short presentation.

The task: 

- Create teams of 2
- Pick a topic - a web app or a website, with some nontrivial functionality; ideally, there'd be a web application server component as well, but that is not strictly required if you have enough "juice" in your frontend
- Once you've selected a topic, reach out to me, and I'll give you some references and technical guidance if relevant

Deliverables:

- A 10-15 minutes presentation during final events period
- A github repo with the code for your implementation and a detailed README with:
    - a description of the work
    - the most interesting challenges you encountered
    - how to bundle and run the code

Possible topics, if you can't think of any:

- Extend the memory game to be a 2 players game (players taking turns playing, playing again when they have a match, the winner being whomever flips the last two cards)
- Extend the picture viewer from class to allow for downloading images and storing them on the server (instead of hot-linking them), and implementing authentication and allowing users to leave comments on pictures
- Extend our classchat in some way (reactions, or allowing the posting of pictures, etc). The repo is [here](https://github.com/rpucella/Class-Chat) but you'll probably need to reach out to me for installation instructions
