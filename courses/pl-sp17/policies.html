    <h3>Late days, Penalties, and Extensions</h3>
    <p>Each student has five &quot;late days&quot; which can be
      applied to any of the homework assignments. A late day
      extends the due date by 24 hours. <b>At most three late days
        can be used on any single assignment.</b> (This allows us
      to grade your assignments are return them to you within a
      reasonable period.)</p>
    <p>Late days are intended to help you manage your time
      effectively. They are not meant to be a substitute for
      starting assignments early. If you exhaust your late days,
      a 10% penalty will be applied per day, up until the
      solutions are released; after the solutions are released,
      no assignments will be accepted. </p>
    <p>Late days are not meant to be used for medical emergencies or
      extenuating circumstances. In those situations, please have your senior tutor contact the instructor.</p>
    
    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>Discussion and the exchange of ideas are essential to doing academic
      work. For assignments in this course, you are encouraged to
      consult with your classmates as you work on problem
      sets. However, after discussions with peers, make sure that you
      can work through the problem yourself and ensure that any answers
      you submit for evaluation are the result of your own efforts. In
      addition, you must cite any books, articles, websites, lectures,
      etc that have helped you with your work using appropriate
      citation practices. Similarly, you must list the names of
      students with whom you have collaborated on problem sets.</p>
    
    <p>Do not pass solutions to problem sets nor accept them from
      another student. Do not post course materials (including problem
      sets, solutions, exams, etc.) to websites or course-content archives. Also, it is never okay to look up solutions to
      homework problems in this class, i.e., don't look on the web for
      solutions. If you are ever in doubt, ask the course staff to
      clarify what is and isn't appropriate. <p>
