# Final Homework 

## Due Date: Sunday, December 18, 2022

- This homework is to be done individually or in teams of 2. You may discuss problems with fellow
students, but all submitted work must be entirely your own, and should not be from any other course,
present, past, or future. If you use a solution from another source you must cite it — this includes
when that source is someone else helping you.

- All programming is to be done in Go (version at least 16).


## Electronic Submission Instructions

Final homework submissions in the usual way, via the chat server.

- When you're ready to submit, log into our <a href="https://chat.rpucella.net">class chat</a>
and click <b>Submit File</b> in the profile menu (your initials in the upper right corner) and select <b>Final Homework</b>. 

- You can submit multiple files, by submitting each separately. Names are not important.

- Submit at least (1) your source .go file; (2) your writeup as an .html or .md file.

## Description

1. choose a data structure or an algorithm that we did not cover in class
2. code the algorithm or data structure in Go
3. write a description and an analysis of the data structure or algorithm
4. provide some use cases and sample applications of the data structure or algorithm
5. write a code walk of your implementation, describing implementation choices and generally how your code works.

Points 3, 4, 5 should be covered in a document, which should be a
standalone document from which anybody having taken the class should
be able to understand the data structure or algorithm. The document
should be in HTML or Markdown (i.e., something that can be converted
to HTML easily) — I will hook those writeups to the course web page
and share with the class.

Some data structures and problems/algorithms that are of interest —
most are covered in the textbook:

- Red-black trees
- 2-3 Tres
- B Trees
- Tries
- Heaps
- Splay Trees
- Binomial Heaps
- Fibonacci Heaps
- Huffman coding
- Maximum flow
- Longest common subsequence
- All-pairs shortest paths
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- String matching
- Convex hulls (computational geometry)
- Approximation algorithms
- Merkle trees
- Distributed hash tables
