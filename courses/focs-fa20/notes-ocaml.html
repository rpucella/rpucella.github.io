    <h1>Notes on OCaml</h1>

    <p><a href="#cheat">Quick Cheat Sheet</a></p>

    <h3>Basic Expressions and Types</h3>
    
    <p>OCaml is an expression-oriented language: everything (except
      top-level definitions) is an expression that evaluates to a value.</p>

    <p>OCaml is <i>statically typed</i>, that is, every expression has
      a type (the type of the value that it evaluates to) and 
      expressions are checked for type correctness before being
      evaluated. OCaml also uses <i>type inference</i>, that is, it
      will try to determine automatically what the type of an expression
      is.</p>

    
    <p>The basic types are integers, floating point numbers, booleans,
      strings, and characters.</p>
    
    <p>Integers and floating point numbers are numeric types.</p>

    <pre>
# 10;;
- : int = 10
# 5.0;;
- : float = 5.
# 10 + 20;;
- : int = 30
</pre>

<p>Integers and floating point numbers do not mix. The basic
  operations <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, and <tt>/</tt> all
  expect integers.</p>

<pre>
# 5.0 + 10;;
Characters 0-3:
  5.0 + 10;;
  ^^^
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int
# 5.0 + 10.0;;
Characters 0-3:
  5.0 + 10.0;;
  ^^^
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int
</pre>

    <p>Floating point numbers have their own
      operations, <tt>+.</tt>, <tt>-.</tt>, <tt>*.</tt>,
      and <tt>/.</tt>.</p>

    <p>Conversion functions are used to convert values from one type
      to another. For instance, function <tt>float</tt> converts an
      integer to a floating point number.</p>

<pre>
# 5.0 +. 10.0;;
- : float = 15.
# float 10;;
- : float = 10.
# float (10);;
- : float = 10.
# float (10) +. 5.0;;
- : float = 15.
</pre>

    <p>Boolean values include <tt>true</tt>
      and <tt>false</tt>. Logical operations <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>
      (and), <tt>||</tt> (or), and <tt>not</tt> are available for
      Booleans. Equality <tt>=</tt> between values <i>of the same
      type</i> returns a Boolean.</p>

<pre>
# true;;
- : bool = true
# false;;
- : bool = false
# true && false;;
- : bool = false
# not(true);;
- : bool = false
# not(false);;
- : bool = true
# 10 = 10;;
- : bool = true
# 5 = 10;;
- : bool = false
# 10 = 10.0;;
Characters 5-9:
  10 = 10.0;;
       ^^^^
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int
# true = 4;;
Characters 7-8:
  true = 4;;
         ^
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type
         bool
</pre>

<p>String literals are constructed with double quotes, while
  characters are constructed with single quotes. Note that a character and a
  single-character string are different values. Operations on strings
  include <tt>^</tt> for concatenation.</p>

<pre>
 # "hello world";;
- : string = "hello world"
# "hello"^"world";;
- : string = "helloworld"
# 'a';;
- : char = 'a'
# 'b';;
- : char = 'b'
# 'abc';;
Characters 0-1:
  'abc';;
  ^
Error: Syntax error
</pre>


<h3>Conditional and Local Definition Expressions</h3>

<p>OCaml evaluates expressions to get values. A
  primitive value is an expression. An operation such as <tt>+</tt>
  applies to expressions is an expression. A function such
  as <tt>float</tt> applied to an expression is an expression.</p>


<p>There are two other ways of forming expressions: conditionals, and
  local definitions.</p>

<p>A conditional expression is an expression of the
  form <tt><b>if</b> <i>condition</i> <b>then</b> <i>expr1</i> <b>else</b> <i>expr2</i></tt>
  and evaluates as follows: first <tt><i>condition</i></tt> is evaluated
  &mdash; if it evaluates to <tt>true</tt>, then <tt><i>expr1</i></tt> is
  evaluated and used as the result of the conditional expression,
  otherwise, <tt><i>expr2</i></tt> is. Of course, <tt><i>expr1</i></tt>
  and <tt><i>expr2</i></tt> can be arbitrary expressions.</p>

<p>Note that you can put parentheses around any expression, just like
  in mathematics, and for the same reason: to disambiguate order of
  operations. Note the use of parenthese in the nested conditional
  example below.</p>

<pre>
# if true then 10 else 20;;
- : int = 10
# if false then 10 else 20;;
- : int = 20
# if 1 = 1 then 10 else 20;;
- : int = 10
# if 1 = 0 then 10 else 20;;
- : int = 20
# if true then 10 + 20 else 30;;
- : int = 30
# if true then (if true then 10 else 20) else 30
  ;;
- : int = 10
# 10 + (if true then 1 else 2);;
- : int = 11
# 10 + (if false then 1 else 2);;
- : int = 12
</pre>

<p>A local definition expression lets you
evaluate an expression to a value to which you can give a name and use
in another expression: <tt><b>let</b> <i>n</i>
  = <i>expr1</i> <b>in</b> <i>expr2</i></tt> first
evaluates <tt><i>expr1</i></tt> to a value <tt><i>v</i></tt>, gives it
name <tt><i>n</i></tt>, and then evaluates <tt><i>expr2</i></tt>,
in which name <tt><i>n</i></tt> has value <tt><i>v</i></tt>. Note that
the fact that <tt><i>n</i></tt> has value <tt><i>v</i></tt> is only
  valid during the evaluation of <tt><i>expr2</i></tt>.</p>

<pre>
# let a = 10 in 2 * a;;
- : int = 20
# 100 + (let a = 20 + 20 in 2 * a);;
- : int = 180
# let a = 10 in let b = 20 in a * b;;
- : int = 200
# a;;
Characters 0-1:
  a;;
  ^
Error: Unbound value a
</pre>


<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>Expressions evaluate to values, and that's the driving engine of
  OCaml. Beside evaluating expressions, you can also write <i>top-level</i> 
  definitions, which define constants and functions. </p>

    <p>A constant is defined by the top-level
      definition <tt><b>let</b> <i>n</i> = <i>expr</i></tt>. Note that
      this <i>looks</i> like a temporary name expression, but it's
      not. There's no <tt><b>in</b></tt>. And once defined, the
      name <tt><i>n</i></tt> is available for any other expression
      evaluated at the shell (or defined later in a program).</p>

    <p>It is important to realize that this defines a <i>constant</i>,
      not a variable. It is not possible to change the value
      of <tt><i>n</i></tt> later. The only thing you can do is define
      a new constant with the same name, but anything you've already
      defined that uses the old name will keep on using the old
      value. Learning to work without variables will be a big part of
      you getting acclimated to OCaml.</p>

    <p>Make sure you understand the examples below.</p>

<pre>
# let x = 10;;
val x : int = 10
# x;;
- : int = 10
# x + 10;;
- : int = 20
# let y = 10 in x * y;;
- : int = 100
# y;;
Characters 0-1:
  y;;
  ^
Error: Unbound value y
# let z = (let y = 10 in 2 * y);;
val z : int = 20
# z;;
- : int = 20
# y;;
Characters 0-1:
  y;;
  ^
Error: Unbound value y
</pre>

<p>Again, OCaml is statically typed, so every defined constant gets a
  type, usually inferred. If OCaml cannot infer a type for the name
  based on the expression, it rejects the definition.</p>

<p>A similar mechanism is used to define functions. A function is
  defined
  by <tt><b>let</b> <i>f</i> <i>arg<sub>1</sub></i> <i>arg<sub>2</sub></i>
    ... <i>arg<sub>k</sub></i> = <i>expr</i></tt>. This defines a function <tt><i>f</i></tt> of
  <i>k</i> arguments, with <tt><i>expr</i></tt> as the body of the function,
  which can refer to arguments <tt><i>arg<sub>1</sub></i></tt>,
  ..., <tt><i>arg<sub>k</sub></i></tt>.
</p>

<p>
  To call a function,
  you use the form <tt><i>f expr<sub>1</sub> ... expr<sub>k</sub></i></tt>, which first
  evaluates <tt><i>expr<sub>1</sub></i></tt>, ..., <tt><i>expr<sub>k</sub></i></tt> to values, and calls
  function <tt><i>f</i></tt> with those values as arguments.</p>

<p>Remember, you can put parentheses around any expression,
  and a function call is an expression.</p>

<pre>
# let c_to_f c = (c *. 9.0 /. 5.0) +. 32.0;;
val c_to_f : float -> float = &lt;fun&gt;
# c_to_f 0.0;;
- : float = 32.
# c_to_f (37.0);;
- : float = 98.6

# let add x y = x + y;;
val ad1 : int -> int -> int = &lt;fun&gt;
# add 10 20;;
- : int = 30
</pre>

    <p>Note that the type of a function expecting arguments of
      type <tt><i>T<sub>1</sub></i></tt>,
      ..., <tt><i>T<sub>k</sub></i></tt> and returning values of
      type <tt><i>T</i></tt>  has the form <tt><i>T<sub>1</sub></i> ->
	... -> <i>T<sub>k</sub></i> -> <i>T</i></tt>.</p>

<p>Again, OCaml is statically typed: OCaml will try to infer the type of the function
  automatically. If it cannot infer the type because you messed
  up the definition, it will complain and refuse to define the
  function. You can only define functions that type check. (Like in
  Java, but unlike Python and JavaScript.)</p>

<pre>
# let c_to_f c = (c *. 9.0 /. 5.0) + 32.0;;
Characters 15-32:
  let c_to_f c = (c *. 9.0 /. 5.0) + 32.0;;
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int
</pre>


<p>Loops in OCaml are implemented using recursive functions. A
  recursive functions requires the <tt><b>rec</b></tt> keyword right
  after the <tt><b>let</b></tt> in the definition. Consider the
  following Python definition of a function which sums up all integers 
  from 0 to n:</p>

<pre>
      def sumto (n):
         result = 0
         index = 0
         while index <= n:
           result += index
           index += 1
         return result
</pre>

<p>The following function pretty much reproduces the above exactly:</p>

<pre>
# let rec sumto_loop index n result = 
   if index <= n
     then sumto_loop (index+1) n (result+index)
   else
     result;;
val sumto_loop : int -> int -> int -> int = &lt;fun&gt;
# let sumto n = sumto_loop 0 n 0;;
val sumto : int -> int = &lt;fun&gt;
# sumto 10;;
- : int = 55
</pre>

<p>A cleaner way to implement this function, however, is to use the
  following intuition: if you have <tt>sumto n = 0 + 1 + ... + n-2 + n-1 + n</tt>
      then in fact:
  <tt>sumto n = (0 + 1 + ... + n-1) + n</tt>
      which is just
  <tt>sumto n = (sumto (n-1)) + n</tt>
  which works fine except when <tt>n = 0</tt>, where you just know that
  <tt>sumto 0 = 0</tt>
  and the above translates to an OCaml definition immediately:</p>

<pre>
# let rec sumto' n = 
    if n = 0 then 0 else sumto' (n-1) + n;;
val sumto' : int -> int = &lt;fun&gt;
# sumto' 10;;
- : int = 55
</pre>

    <p>Note that <tt>'</tt> (prime) is an acceptable character in a
    name, as long as it is at the end of the name. This usage is
    similar to the use of prime symbols in mathematics. Note that
    the prime symbol does not have any special meaning &mdash; it is just
    a symbol like any other, though it cannot be used to start an identifier.</p>


    
    <h3>Structured Data</h3>
    
<p>Tuples and lists let us package values together.</p>

<p>A tuple is created using parentheses and commas to separate the
  values in the tuple.</p>
<pre>
# (10,20);;
- : int * int = (10, 20)
</pre>

<p>The values in different positions of a tuple need not have the same
  type. Note the resulting tuple type, which uses <tt>*</tt>:</p>
<pre>
# (10, "hello");;
- : int * string = (10, "hello")
# (10, true, "help");;
- : int * bool * string = (10, true, "help")
</pre>

<p>You can of course package tuples as elements of other tuples. Note
  the types &mdash;  tuple of three elements, where the third element is a tuple of
     two elements, is different from a tuple of four elements.</p>

<pre>
# (1,"hello",(10,20));;
- : int * string * (int * int) = (1, "hello", (10, 20))
# (1,"hello",10,20);;
- : int * string * int * int = (1, "hello", 10, 20)
</pre>

<p>How do you get values out of a tuple? You use <i>pattern
    matching</i>, which is our last expression form, and which is
  quite versatile.</p>

<pre>
# match a with (x,y) -> x;;
- : int = 10
# match a with (x,y) -> x + y;;
- : int = 30
</pre>

<p>Here's a function that takes a pair and sums its two elements:</p>

<pre>
# let addpair p = match p with (x,y) -> x + y;;
val addpair : int * int -> int = &lt;fun&gt;
# addpair (10,20);;
- : int = 30
</pre>

<p>This looks very much like we're calling a function with two
     arguments in a language like Python or JavaScript.</p>


<p>Lists, as opposed to tuples, can have 
     arbitrary length, but are restricted to values of the same type; the
  type of the list indicates the type of its content.</p>

<pre>
# [10;20;30];;
- : int list = [10; 20; 30]
# ["hello"; "world"];;
- : string list = ["hello"; "world"]
</pre>

    <p>Note the use of <tt>;</tt> to separate the elements of the
      list. If you use <tt>,</tt> you will get odd type error
      messages.</p>

<p>You can add values to the
     front of a list using the :: operator.  This creates a new list
     with that element in front. Lists are immutable. You can't change
     their elements once they've been created. Any operation on lists
     returns new lists.</p>

<pre>
# 1::[2;3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# "hello"::[2;3];;
Characters 10-11:
  "hello"::[2;3];;
            ^
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type
         string
</pre>


<p>Since lists are recursive structures, it makes sense to use recursive
     functions to traverse a list. To take a list apart, we can use
     pattern matching, just like for tuples. To pattern match on a list
     you check whether the list is empty, or if it's not empty, then 
     you match on the first element of the list and the rest of the
  list, using the following "pattern":</p>
<pre>
  <b>match</b> <i>list-expression</i> <b>with</b>
    [] -> <i>expr for an empty list</i>
  | h::t -> <i>expr a nonempty list (with first element h and rest t)</i>
</pre>
    <p>The <tt>h</tt> and <tt>t</tt> are user-selected names that get bound to the head
      and the tail of the list, respectively</p>

    <p>You can get pretty fancy if you want. You can add match cases if you want to, to deal with special cases, such as <tt>[x]</tt> for a one-element list, or <tt>x::(y::xs)</tt> for a list with at least two elements (yes, patterns can nest). For example, the following function returns 0 for an empty list, the first element for a list of length 1, and the second element for a list of length more than 1:
<pre>
# let rec firstOrSecond l = 
    match l with
      [] -> 0
    | [x] -> x
    | x::(y::xs) -> y
val firstOrSecond : int list -> int = &lt;fun&gt;
</pre>

    <p>For the <i>vast</i> majority of recursive functions on lists you'll have to write though, the standard pattern of empty/non-empty is sufficient.</p>

<p>Here's a function to sum the elements of a list of integers. Note
  the type of the function, which makes it clear it expects a list of integers.</p>

<pre>
# let rec sum_list l = 
    match l with
      [] -> 0
    | head::tail -> head + (sum_list tail);;
val sum_list : int list -> int = &lt;fun&gt;
# sum_list [1;2;3];;
- : int = 6
# sum_list [1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10];;
- : int = 55
</pre>

    <p>Here's a similar function, to compute the length of a list.</p>

<pre>
# let rec length l = 
    match l with
      [] -> 0
    | head::tail -> 1 + (length tail);;
val length : 'a list -> int = &lt;fun&gt;
</pre>

<p>Something funny here: the length of a list does not depend on its
     content, and in particular, does not depend on the type of the
     values it contents. OCaml notices, and gives the function a
     <i>polymorphic</i> type: the function works with a list of any type, 
     represented by the type <tt>'a list</tt>, where <tt>'a</tt> is called  
     a type variable.</p>

<pre>
# length [1;2;3];;
- : int = 3
# length ["hello"; "world"];;
- : int = 2
# length [];;
- : int = 0
</pre>

<p>This also gives you a hint as to what the type of an empty list
  is: it is polymorphic.</p>
<pre>
# [];;
- : 'a list = []
</pre>

<p>There is more to polymorphic functions that just being able to take
     arguments of various types. They can also track the result type of
     a function as a function of its argument types. As an example, let's
     look at a function that expects a list of pairs, and returning the list 
  of all the first components of the pairs.</p>

    <p>First: what does a list of pairs look like? Note the type.</p>

<pre>
# [(1,"hello"); (2,"world")];;
- : (int * string) list = [(1, "hello"); (2, "world")]
</pre>

<p>Here's the function to project out all the first components. Again,
  note the type: it expects a list of pairs, each of type <tt>('a * 'b)</tt>
  for some <tt>'a</tt> and some <tt>'b</tt>, and returns an <tt>'a list</tt>, that is, it returns
     a list whose type depend on the type of the first component of the
  pairs in the list passed as an argument.</p>

<pre>
# let rec projectFirst l = 
    match l with
      [] -> []
    | (x,y)::tail -> x::(projectFirst tail);;
val projectFirst : ('a * 'b) list -> 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</pre>

    <p>If we call <tt>projectFirst</tt> with a list of type <tt>(int * string) list</tt>, 
      that is, where <tt>'a = int</tt> and <tt>'b = string</tt>, we
      expect a list of type <tt>'a = int</tt>
     as a result. And indeed:
<pre>
# projectFirst [(1,"hello"); (2,"world")];;
- : int list = [1; 2]
</pre>
