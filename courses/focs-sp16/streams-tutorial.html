(* TUTORIAL FROM CLASS 4/14/2016 *)


(* The underlying implementation for streams 
 *
 * Basically, a stream is a pair of an element and a 
 * "promise" to compute the rest of the stream.
 * 
 * That "promise" is represented as a function
 *
 * The implementation memoizes that function: once the function is
 * called once, it remembers its result, and subsequent calls to the
 * function directly return the result without executing the body of
 * the function
 *
 * You don't need to know anything about this code -- you will
 * use functions defined below instead
 *)
