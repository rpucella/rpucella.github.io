    <p>This course explores the central object of study of Computer
    Science, namely the notion of computation. We're going to develop
    formal tools for defining what we mean by computation, through
    various forms of automata. We'll develop ways to talk about the
    efficiency of computations, by quantifying their time
    complexity. We will examine alternative models of
    computations, and see how they correspond to different
    programming paradigms: functional programming, logic programming,
    and object-oriented programming. We will end with a discussion of
    basic data structures and algorithms.

      <h3>Course Information</h3>

      <p>Prerequisites: ENGR 2520 (can be taken concurrently, though it's not particularly recommended)</p>

      <p>Instructor: <a href="http://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (<a id="send_email" href="#">send email</a>)</p>

      <p>Office hours: Thu 15:00-16:00 / MH 353</p>

      <p>Textbook: There are several excellent books on Theory of Computation
      (the first part of the course), but they are expensive and we
      would be covering only a small part of their content. So
      instead, I settled on an inexpensive book that I will feel free
      to pick and choose from:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Tom
	Stuart, <i><a href="http://computationbook.com">Understanding Computation</a></i></li>
      </ul>
	

	
      <p>Programming: All programming in this course will be done
      using the programming
      language <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. The OCaml
      interpreter can be downloaded from the web site, and
	supports installations on most common systems. Here are a couple of reasonable books on OCaml that you might
      want to get your hands on if you prefer learning your
      programming language from a book instead of the web:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Hickey, <i><a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf">Introduction
	      to Objective Caml</a></i> (PDF)</li>
	<li>Downey,
	  Monje, <i><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkocaml/">Think
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
	<li>Minsky, Madhavapeddy,
	  Hickey, <i><a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">Real World
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
      </ul>


      <p>Grading: The final grade is based on weekly homework (60%)
      and two exams (20% each). All work will be done
      individually. Late homeworks will be penalized (10% per 24 hours)
      and no homework will be accepted after its solution has been
      discussed in class.

      <p>Ninjas: We have two ninjas for the class, Sophia Seitz and Siddharth Singal. You can figure out their email addresses &mdash; they're both Olin students. They will host a tutorial section <b>every Monday 17:00-18:00 (AC 318)</b>. It is not mandatory to attend, but strongly recommended. In addition, they will hold the following office hours:
<ul>
  <li>Sidd: Saturday 8-10 (EH4 Lounge)</li>
  <li>Sidd: Tuesday 6-9 (EH4 Lounge)</li>
  <li>Sophia: Mondays 4-5 (AC 318)</li>
  <li>Sophia: Tuesdays 6-8 (EH4 Lounge)</li>
</ul>
      </p>

      <p>I will expect all of us to follow the <a href="http://www.olin.edu/academic-life/student-affairs-resources/student-life/honor-code/">Olin Honor Code</a>.</p>

		  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">&Eacute;variste

		  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems">Hilbert's

		  in Paris in
		    1900. His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_tenth_problem">tenth
		      problem</a> spoke directly to the notion of computation.</p>

		  <p>The <a href="tutorial.html">sample code</a> I
		    demoed in class. You can <a href="tutorial.ml">download it as a source file</a>. From the OCaml shell in the same
		  directory as the file, type <tt>#use
		  "tutorial.ml"</tt>. </p> 

		  <p>An <a href="ocaml-interaction.html">annotated

		  <p><a href="http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~dmatusze/resources/ocaml/ocaml.html"><i>A
			Concise Introduction to Objective Caml</i></a> &mdash;
		  written for OCaml v3; one difference is that you

		  <p>Some information on

		  <p>There are no official IDEs for OCaml, but many
		    people swear
		    by <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop"><i>utop</i></a>,
		    which is an OCaml shell replacement. There's also
		    <a href="http://camelia.sourceforge.net/"><i>Camelia</i></a>,
		    but I've never used it. Sidd, one of our ninjas,
		    mentioned that there is an <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/">Eclipse plug-in for
		      OCaml</a>. (If you want to go that route, please
		    get in touch with him &mdash; the installation has
		    a few subtleties that he's already navigated through.)</p>

		  <p>Read <b>Chapter 3</b> of the book (<i>The Simplest

		  after nondeterministic and deterministic finite
		  automata, a slightly more general form, a
		  nondeterministic finite automaton with <i>free

		  <p>I mentionned at the beginning of class examples of languages that were not regular, such as &lcub;a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup> | n &ge; 0&rcub;, are not regular. We don't have any way right now to show that a language is not regular. The most common tool used is the <i>Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages</i>. Here's a reasonable <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse322/08au/lec9.pdf">reference</a>.</p>

		  <p>Read <b>Chapter 5</b> of the <i>Understanding
		      Computation</i> book.</p>

		  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">Church-Turing thesis</a>.</p>

		  <p>If you're curious about what other machines
		  aside from finite automata and Turing machines are used
		    in the field, read through <b>Chapter 4</b> of
		    the <i>Understanding Computation</i> book, which
		  describes pushdown automata &mdash; basically a
		    finite automaton equipped with a stack. This gives you a class of machines that lands midway between finite automata and Turing machines in terms of the class of languages they can accept.</p>
