    <p>This course explores the central object of study of Computer
    Science, namely the notion of computation. We're going to develop
    formal tools for defining what we mean by computation, through
    various forms of automata. We'll develop ways to talk about the
    efficiency of computations, by quantifying their time
    complexity. We will examine alternative models of
    computations, and see how they correspond to different
    programming paradigms: functional programming, logic programming,
    and object-oriented programming. We will end with a discussion of
    basic data structures and algorithms.

      <h3>Course Information</h3>

      <p>Prerequisites: ENGR 2520 (can be taken concurrently, though it's not particularly recommended)</p>

      <p>Instructor: <a href="http://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (<a id="send_email" href="#">send email</a>)</p>

      <p>Office hours: Thu 15:00-16:00 / MH 353</p>

      <p>Textbook: There are several excellent books on Theory of Computation
      (the first part of the course), but they are expensive and we
      would be covering only a small part of their content. So
      instead, I settled on an inexpensive book that I will feel free
      to pick and choose from:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Tom
	Stuart, <i><a href="http://computationbook.com">Understanding Computation</a></i></li>
      </ul>
	

	
      <p>Programming: All programming in this course will be done
      using the programming
      language <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>. The OCaml
      interpreter can be downloaded from the web site, and
	supports installations on most common systems. Here are a couple of reasonable books on OCaml that you might
      want to get your hands on if you prefer learning your
      programming language from a book instead of the web:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Hickey, <i><a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs134/cs134b/book.pdf">Introduction
	      to Objective Caml</a></i> (PDF)</li>
	<li>Downey,
	  Monje, <i><a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkocaml/">Think
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
	<li>Minsky, Madhavapeddy,
	  Hickey, <i><a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">Real World
	  OCaml</a></i></li>
      </ul>


      <p>Grading: The final grade is based on weekly homework (60%)
      and two exams (20% each). All work will be done
      individually. Late homeworks will be penalized (10% per 24 hours)
      and no homework will be accepted after its solution has been
      discussed in class.

      <p>Ninjas: We have two ninjas for the class, Sophia Seitz and Siddharth Singal. You can figure out their email addresses &mdash; they're both Olin students. They will host a tutorial section <b>every Monday 17:00-18:00 (AC 318)</b>. It is not mandatory to attend, but strongly recommended. In addition, they will hold the following office hours:
<ul>
  <li>Sidd: Saturday 8-10 (EH4 Lounge)</li>
  <li>Sidd: Tuesday 6-9 (EH4 Lounge)</li>
  <li>Sophia: Mondays 4-5 (AC 318)</li>
  <li>Sophia: Tuesdays 6-8 (EH4 Lounge)</li>
</ul>
      </p>

      <p>I will expect all of us to follow the <a href="http://www.olin.edu/academic-life/student-affairs-resources/student-life/honor-code/">Olin Honor Code</a>.</p>

		<div class="lect">

		  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">&Eacute;variste
		  Galois</a>, who proved that there is no general
		    formula for the solutions of the  quintic
		  equation.</p>

		  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems">Hilbert's
		  problems</a>, ten of which were presented at the ICM
		  in Paris in
		    1900. His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_tenth_problem">tenth
		      problem</a> spoke directly to the notion of computation.</p>

		  <p>The <a href="tutorial.html">sample code</a> I
		    demoed in class. You can <a href="tutorial.ml">download it as a source file</a>. From the OCaml shell in the same
		  directory as the file, type <tt>#use
		  "tutorial.ml"</tt>. </p> 

		  <p>An <a href="ocaml-interaction.html">annotated
		  variant</a> of the sample interaction with OCaml I
		  gave in class.</p> 

		  <p><a href="http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~dmatusze/resources/ocaml/ocaml.html"><i>A
			Concise Introduction to Objective Caml</i></a> &mdash;
		  written for OCaml v3; one difference is that you
		  should write <tt>#use "file.ml";;</tt> to load a

		  <p>Some information on
		    the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/toplevel.html#sec256">commands

		  <p>There are no official IDEs for OCaml, but many
		    people swear
		    by <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop"><i>utop</i></a>,
		    which is an OCaml shell replacement. There's also
		    <a href="http://camelia.sourceforge.net/"><i>Camelia</i></a>,
		    but I've never used it. Sidd, one of our ninjas,
		    mentioned that there is an <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/">Eclipse plug-in for

		  <p>Read <b>Chapter 3</b> of the book (<i>The Simplest

		  after nondeterministic and deterministic finite
		  automata, a slightly more general form, a

		  <p>I mentionned at the beginning of class examples of languages that were not regular, such as &lcub;a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup> | n &ge; 0&rcub;, are not regular. We don't have any way right now to show that a language is not regular. The most common tool used is the <i>Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages</i>. Here's a reasonable <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse322/08au/lec9.pdf">reference</a>.</p>

		  <p>Read <b>Chapter 5</b> of the <i>Understanding
		      Computation</i> book.</p>

		  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">Church-Turing thesis</a>.</p>

		  <p>If you're curious about what other machines
		  aside from finite automata and Turing machines are used
		    in the field, read through <b>Chapter 4</b> of
		    the <i>Understanding Computation</i> book, which
		  describes pushdown automata &mdash; basically a
		    finite automaton equipped with a stack. This gives you a class of machines that lands midway between finite automata and Turing machines in terms of the class of languages they can accept.</p>

	    <p>The dataflow networks that I presented in class. No words, just the diagrams: <a href="dataflow-1.jpg">page 1</a> (building blocks), <a href="dataflow-2.jpg">page 2</a> (nats, evens, odds, triangular numbers), <a href="dataflow-3.jpg">page 3</a> (squares, fibonnacci numbers), <a href="dataflow-4.jpg">page 4</a> (partial sums, running average, sieve of Eratosthenes).</p>

	    <p>The <a href="streams-tutorial.html">streams programming tutorial</a> I gave in class.</p>

	    <p>There are two main sources for the dataflow
	    computational model, neither of which is exactly what I
	    presented in class: Gilles Kahn's work
	    on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks">Kahn
		Process Networks</a>, and Jack Dennis's work on
	    <a href="http://www.capsl.udel.edu/courses/cpeg852/2014/slides/Topic-A-Dataflow-part1.pdf">dataflow
	      architectures</a>.</p>

	    <p>The programming
	      language <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">elm</a> is used
	      to program web front-ends. While not directly
	      dataflow-based, it is based on an asynchronous version
	      of what I described in class, though you really have to
	      dig to find it.</p>

	  <div class="lect">
	    <p>Determining the running time of recursive functions
	    (i.e., anything you write in Ocaml) requires solving
	    recurrence equations. There is no general method for
	    solving recurrence equations, but many different
	      techniques that apply in subsets of cases. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~reif/courses/alglectures/skiena.lectures/lecture3.pdf">This</a> is a
	    reasonable
	      overview. <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rweba/algf09/solverecurrencesSF.pdf">This</a>
	    goes into more detail about the so-called <i>iteration
		method:</i> substitute until you spot a pattern.</p>

	    <p>Wikipedia page
	    on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary
	    search trees</a> and on the version of self-balanced
	    binary search trees I described in
	    class, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">AVL
	    trees</a>. The description of the rotations that restore
	    the balanced height property after an insertion is
	    reasonably clear there. There are basically four cases to
	      consider, depending on the local form of unbalance.</p>
	    <p>A <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html">cute visualization</a> of what happens when you insert
	    into an AVL tree. Try starting with the empty tree, and
	    inserting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... You'll see the tree
	      grow "to the right" and then rebalance itself repeatedly.</p>
