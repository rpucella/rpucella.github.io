      <p>Interactive data visualization sits at the intersection of graphic design and programming. 
         The ideal visualization needs to be easy to understand and aesthetically pleasing, but also 
         interactively navigable, permit different views of the data, and be responsive no matter the 
         amount of data being displayed. The course will focus on the technological aspects of data 
         visualization, from databases and data structures and algorithms to process data, to 
         technologies for interactive visualization such as Javascript/D3.  Course work will be 
         project-driven, based on existing available large data sets. By the end of the course, 
         we should be able to construct visualizations such as 
         <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/world-cup/">2014 World Cup Predictions</a>  or  
         <a href="http://ri.id.au/closethegap">Close the Gap</a>.</p>

      <h3>Course Info</h3>


      <p>Prerequisites: ENGR 2510 (Software Design)</p>

      <p>Instructor: <a href="http://www.rpucella.net">Riccardo Pucella</a> (<a id="send_email" href="#">send email</a>)</p>

      <p>Office hours: Mon 16:00-18:00 / MH 353</p>

      <p>We will use two books:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Scott Murray, <i><a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345">Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</a></i></li>
	<li>Douglas
	Crockford, <i><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">JavaScript:
	The Good Parts</a></i></li>
      </ul>
	
      <p>These books are mostly for reference, but they are good
      references. They provide a narrative that is otherwise lost when
      you look up information online. Murray's book covers D3, the main
      JavaScript library we will use to develop our visualizations. Crockford's book
      covers the non-objectionable parts of the JavaScript
      language, and gives a good sense of the coding style that
      I'll be using.</p>

      <p>Grading: The grade in this course is based on project work: project 1 (10%), projects 2-5 (15% each), 
      final project (30%). Projects are to be completed in teams of three. Those teams will be determined by the instructor (in a combination of random
      selection and cycling) and will be different for each project. Late projects will be penalized. Email the instructor for 
      detail on said penalties.  </p>

      <!-- <p>Late work policy: Homeworks are due at the beginning of lecture on the due date. The penalty for late homeworks is 10% per 24 hours. Note that I will usually discuss the homework that has been submitted on the first lecture past the due date. (Since homeworks are due on Thursdays, that would then usually be the following Monday.) Once I've done that, I will no longer be able to accept late submissions.</p> -->

	  <div class="lect">
	    <p>No slides for this one. I sketched everything out on the whiteboard, with lots of code.</p>
	    <p>The data I used is the NCHS data, specifically the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm#Mortality_Multiple">Mortality Multiple Cause</a> datasets, the ones we will be using for Project 4.</p>
	    <p>I pushed the 2013 and the 2008 datasets into a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database, which can be accessed from Python using the convenient <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html">sqlite3</a> module. SQLite uses SQL as a query language. <a href="http://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/tutorial/SQL/Overview/">Here is a reasonably short tutorial that is not SQLite-specific.</a></p> 
	    <p>A small web server written in Python using the <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html">bottle</a> micro web-framework is used to pull the data from the database and deliver it to a front end. The server sends aggregated data to the front end.</p>
	    <p>A simple front end pulls data from the web server and displays it.</p>
	    <p>The sample
	    code:<br>
	      - <a href="mortality.db">mortality.db</a>, the
		  database, a severely cut down version of the full data<br>
	      -  <a href="mortality-server.py">mortality-server.py</a>,
		  the Python web server (uses the bottle framework)<br>
	      -  <a href="mortality-demo.html">mortality-demo.html</a>,
		  the front end.<br>
	      You need to run the web
	      server before you can run the demo. Put all the files in
	      the same folder, and run the web server from that
	      folder. You may need to load the HTML file through the
	      web server,
	      as <tt>localhost:8080/mortality-demo.html</tt>, with the
	      port number you selected.

	  <div class="lect">

	    <p>Due date: <i>Mon Sep 21 at noon</i></p>

	    <p>Each of the questions below ask you to draw something in a canvas. I've provided you with a <a href="project1.html">skeleton HTML file</a> that holds three canvases. (You'll want to right-click and <i>save as</i>.) The HTML file calls a function <tt>run()</tt> upon loading. You should put calls to your drawing functions in that function.</p>

<ol>

<li>(SCENERY)

<p>Code a function <tt>drawScenery()</tt> that draws a scenery (landscape, cityscape, etc) in the canvas with ID <tt>canvas-q1</tt>. Don't use images. Construct everything using the basic drawing primitives. Chances are it'll look like something out of a kindergarden class. That's perfectly okay. In fact, even good. You should try to be original. I did not even try.</p>

<img src="./house1.png" height="200" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></img>
<p style="margin-top: 30px;">"This is my drawing of a house. There are many like it, but this one is mine." (Riccardo, 6 y.o., Elizabeth-Turgeon School)</p>
<p style="clear:both;">Make sure you call <tt>drawScenery()</tt> from <tt>run()</tt>.
</li>

<li>(TURTLE GRAPHICS)
<p>
  Paths in a canvas are defined using lines and arcs given in term of canvas coordinates. An alternate approach is to define a path by a sequence of "moves": starting at a given position pointing in a given direction, move forward 100 units, turn left 45 degrees, then forward 100 units, etc. This approach to drawing is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">turtle graphics</a>.</p>

  <p>We are going to represent the sequence of moves using an array. I will describe it using examples. The following array represents moving forward 100 units: <tt>["f",100]</tt>. The following array represents moving forward 100 units, turning right 45 degrees, moving forward 60 units, turning left 45 degrees, then moving forward 100 units: <tt>["f",100,"r",45,"f",60,"l",45,"f",100]</tt>. Makes sense?</p>

  <p>Just for kicks, let's add another feature. A move <tt>pu</tt> will "lift the pen off the page" so that subsequent moves are still considered but they are not actually drawn. A move <tt>pd</tt> will "put the pen back on the page" so that subsequent moves now draw again.</p>

  <p>Code a function <tt>draw(ctxt,x,y,moves)</tt> that takes a context <tt>ctxt</tt> on a canvas, an initial position (<tt>x</tt>,<tt>y</tt>) in the canvas, and a sequences of <tt>moves</tt> as above, and draws the corresponding path in the canvas. </p>

  <p>By default, the initial direction should be the unit vector of the x-axis (i.e., facing east if the canvas was a map in the standard orientation). The pen is initially down.</p>

  <p>The following should draw the letter H in a context <tt>ctxt</tt> at position (100,100):</p>
<pre>
    draw(ctxt,100,100,["f",40,
		       "r",90,
		       "f",40,
		       "l",90,
		       "f",20,
		       "l",90,
		       "f",40,
		       "r",90,

		       "f",100,
		       "r",90,
		       "f",40,

</pre>
  <p>Code a function that draws something interesting in the canvas with ID <tt>canvas-q2</tt> using your <tt>draw()</tt> function. You should try a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_curve">space-filling curve</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch snowflake</a>. Make sure you call your function from <tt>run()</tt></p>
  
  <p>You'll want to review your basic trigonometry. Sine and cosine functions are available in JavaScript as <tt>Math.sin()</tt> and <tt>Math.cos()</tt>.
  They expect angles in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radians</a>, which range from 0 to <tt>Math.PI*2</tt>. The angles
  in the sequence of moves should be in degrees.</p>
</li>

<li>(SIMPLE ANIMATION)

  <p>Code a function <tt>drawAnimScenery()</tt> that draws the scenery you designed in Question 1 in canvas with ID <tt>canvas-q3</tt> and animates in an interesting way.</p>

  <img src="./house2.gif" height="200" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></img>
  <p>How do you do animation? Exactly as you would expect: an animation is a movie, and a movie is just a sequence of pictures (frames) shown at regular intervals. So the trick is to repeatedly draw into the canvas, one frame at a time, erasing the canvas between each frame.</p>

  <p> On the right is an animation I constructed from my scenery above. It's actually an animated GIF because I can't well put in my canvas animation code right here, can I? (Unfortunately, the animated GIF coder is buggy, and messes up colors. Thus the weird effects in the cloud and the sun. Ignore that. Canvas animation will be fine.)</p>

  <p>There's a bit of a subtlety in doing animation in the browser: you can't just write a for-loop and draw repeatedly in the canvas within that for-loop. Most browsers only render the canvas when control <i>returns</i> from JavaScript back to the browser. So if you animate in a for-loop, all you'll see is the last frame you ended up drawing, assuming your for-loop terminates. (Remember when I said in class that the inverted program structure forced on you by the browser has consequences? This is one of those.) So what you want to do is have the <i>browser</i> control the looping. Have a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval">setInterval()</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">requestAnimationFrame()</a>, that should give you some hint. If you're stuck, get in touch with me.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">Make sure you call <tt>drawAnimScenery()</tt> from <tt>run()</tt>.

	  <div class="lect">

	    <p>Due date: <i>Mon Oct 19 at 23:59</i></p>

	    <p><a href="teams-project2.txt">Team assignments</a>. (If you need help contacting your partner, or if I missed you, please get in touch with me.)</p>

	    <p>In this project, you will come up with (static) visualisations for the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/mobile-messaging-and-social-media-2015/">Mobile Messaging and Social Media 2015</a> Pew Research Center data.</p>

	    <p>I am keeping this project pretty unstructured as a
	    trial run. If that works well, upcoming projects will
	    remain unstructured. The idea is to have you explore and
	    try things out as much as possible.</p> 

	    
	    <p>First off, download the report above. The report, among
	    other things, gives you percentages of online users using
	    one of five social media sites (Facebook, Pinterest,
	    Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter), cut across demographic
	    segments (gender, race, age, education, income, and
	      residential area). </p>

	    <p>Then, I want you to implement visualizations for the
	    data. The visualizations I want:
	      <ul>
		<li>For each social site and each demographic segment,
		a chart showing the percentage of online users using
		that social site split across all the groups in the
		segment. (Visualizations of the first type)
		<li>For each demographic segment, a chart showing the
		percentage of online users using each of the 
		social 		sites across all the groups in the
		  segments. (Visualizations of the second type)</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>You will have to enter the data yourself
	    unfortunately, but on the flip side, you will have full
	    freedom to choose whatever data layout that you think will
	    help you. Then, I suggest you proceed in three phases:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li><p>Pick one visualization of the first type (one site,
	      one segment) and figure out a nice chart for it and
	      implement it. Ideally, you should be able to parametrize
	      the process that you use so that you can chart any site
	      and segment. Do the same for one vizualization of the
	      second type.</p>
	      <p>Don't restrict yourself to bar charts. You can
	      explore dot charts, bubble charts, heat maps, anything
	      that you think can help a viewer understand what are
	      the most popular sites/segments in each of the
	      visualizations. I leave it up to you what you choose to
	      emphasize, what you think it important.</p> </li>
	      
	      <li><p>Extend what you did above so that you visualize
		  <i>all</i> of the data: all the visualizations of the first type,
	      all the visualizations of the second type.</p></li>

	      <li><p>Wrap it up in a nice bow: put all of the
	      visualizations on a web page that is usable and
	      reasonably nice to look at. As I said in
	      class, it's fine if all the charts are all on the page,
	      just order them and lay them out in some reasonable
	      fashion. (<i>I will talk about how to lay out multiple
	      charts in the next lecture</i>.) If you know how to use
	      buttons and selectors on a web page, feel free to use
	      those to make the page less overwhelming. If you don't
	      know how to use them, don't worry, we'll look at them in
		  the next module. They are not required here.</p></li>
	    </ol>

	    <p>I recommend you keep it all in one single HTML file, but
	    you do not have to. I ask that you place the data directly
	    into the file like in the third lecture's examples (as
	    opposed to pulling it from a CSV file, say) and that you
	      use D3 as the SVG manipulation library.</p>

	  <div class="lect">

	    <p>Due date: <i>Mon Nov 2 at 23:59</i></p>

	    <p><a href="teams-project3.txt">Team assignments</a>. (If you need help contacting your partner, or if I missed you, please get in touch with me.)</p>

	    <p>In this project, you will come up with a dynamic
	    visualisation for
	    the <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/">Pew Research
	    Global Attitudes</a>, using their 2013 data.</p>  

	    <p>Again, this is pretty unstructured. 
	      The idea is to have you explore and
	    try things out as much as possible.</p> 

	    <ol>
	      <li>
	    <p>Have a look at the <a href="project3/Pew Research Global Attitudes Project Spring 2013 Questionnaire for Web.pdf">survey questionnaire</a>. 
	      The Global Attitudes Project collects data from a
	      survey given to residents of various countries. 
	      Note that not everyone is asked every question
	      necessarily: some questions are asked only in some
	      countries, while some questions are asked only if the
	      answer to a previous question is a specific one.</p>

	    <p>Identify a few (between 5 and 10) of the questions that
	    you find interesting. That's going to be highly
	    personal. Those are the questions that you are going to
	    visualize.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li>
		<p>Get the dataset that corresponds to the
		  countries you want to include in the visualization. Turns
		  out that the dataset is too large to comfortably be loaded
		  all at once into the browser. (At least, on my
		  system. Your mileage may vary.) Here are the datasets you
		  can use: 
		  <a href="project3/america.csv.zip">America (North and South)</a>,
		  <a href="project3/africa.csv.zip">Africa</a>,
		  <a href="project3/europe.csv.zip">Europe</a>,
		  <a href="project3/middle.csv.zip">Middle East</a>,
		  <a href="project3/apac.csv.zip">Asia-Pacific</a>.
		  All of these datasets are CSV files (zipped), where the first
		  line of the file is the header names for the columns,
		  and each subsequent line records the survey answers for
		  one respondent. There is a column for every question on
		  the survey questionnaire. The column headers reflect the names that
		  appear in the survey questionnaire.</p>
		
		<p>You can get a <a href="project3/Pew Research Global Attitudes Project Spring 2013 Topline for Web.pdf">summary of the survey data</a>, aggregated as
		  percentage of all respondents to each question, per
		  country.</p>
	      </li>
	      
	      <li>
		<p>Create a dynamic visualization (with one or more
	      views) of the questions you chose, for the countries you
	      chose.
	      How should you visualize that data? 
		  That's up to you. Certainly, the first step will be
		  to read in the CSV file containing your data, and
		  then use that data to create one (or more)
		  visualization. I will ask you to focus on switching and
		  filtering interactions. So you will probably want to
		  allow the user to switch between the various questions you
		  decided were interesting, and also allow the user to
		  filter the data based on the answers to other
		  questions that you think would make for interesting
		  segments. You should feel free to
		  combine questions in the same view, if you want,
		  and if it is relevant to the data you want to
	      showcase.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li><p> As usual, wrap it up in a bow, and try to make
		  it pretty. </p></li>
	    </ol>


	    <p>In the coming days, I will post a few dynamic
	    visualizations that may help spark your imagination. If
	    you have doubts as to whether what you're thinking of is
	    reasonable, feel free to drop me an email with your idea,
	      and I'll tell you.</p>

	    <p>I recommend you create a folder for the project and
	    place all your files in that folder, including the CSV
	    file containing your data. It's probably a good idea to
	    place your JavaScript code in its own file as well. If you
	    don't know how to link your HTML page to an external
	    JavaScript file, find out how. It's not difficult. Again,
	    I ask that you use D3 as the SVG manipulation library to
	    create your views.</p>

	  <div class="lect">

	    <p>Due date: <i>Wed Nov 18 at 23:59</i></p>

	    <p><a href="teams-project4.txt">Team assignments</a>. (If
	    you need help contacting your partner, or if I missed you,
	    please get in touch with me.)</p> 

	    <p>In this project, you will come up with a dynamic
	    visualisation for
	    the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm#Mortality_Multiple">NCHS
	    Mortality Multiple Cause</a> data.</p>  

	    <p>That data is large, so you will need some back-end
	    support. To make sure I can work with your submission, I
	    will ask you to create a small web server in
	    the <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html">Python
		Bottle framework</a>, that pulls from a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite database</a>
	    containing the data. There's nothing special about those
	    technologies except for the fact that they're super easy
	    to set up and require no infrastructure to speak of. You
	    will also create a D3 front-end to the data for
	    visualization purposes, as we've done since the
	    beginning. See the November 2nd lecture for examples.</p>

	    <p>I've split up the project in two parts.</p>

	    <ol>
	      <li> 
		<p>
		  Download the mortality data files
		  for <a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DVS/mortality/mort2003us.zip">2003</a>,
		  <a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DVS/mortality/mort2008us.zip">2008</a>,
		  and <a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DVS/mortality/mort2013us.zip">2013</a>.
		</p>
		<p>As I mentioned in class, they are in some baroque
		data format. I've provided you with
		a <a href="project4/makedb.py">python script to take
		one of those files and push its data into a SQLite
		database</a>. Running <tt>python makedb.py
		&lt;dataset&gt;</tt> will create a
		file <tt>mortality.db</tt> (if it doesn't already
		exist in the current folder) containing a
		table <tt>mortality</tt>, and push the dataset into
		the table. (Running <tt>makedb.py</tt> in the presence
		of an existing <tt>mortality.db</tt> file will simply
		add the data to the <tt>mortality</tt> table in the
		database. Don't push the same dataset twice, or you'll
		get duplicated data.)
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Please don't alter the data. I'll be running your
		  code with my own database.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Once you have a file <tt>mortality.db</tt>
		  containing the 2003, 2008, and 2013 mortality data,
		  write a Python web server in Bottle that can access
		  the mortality database using
		  the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html">sqlite3</a>
		  module. 
		</p>

		<p>
		  As a first step, have the web server response to GET
		  requests at URI <tt>/test</tt> by returning a JSON
		  file containing the following data:
		</p>

		<ul>
		  <li>For each cause of death in the <tt>Cause_Recode_39</tt> column, the average age of the persons that died from that cause, for each year.</li>
		  <li>For each age, the top cause of death (as per the <tt>Cause_Record_39</tt>) for deaths at that age, for each year.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Structure the JSON however you see fit.</p>

		<p>
		  Write a simple HTML file <tt>test.html</tt> that
		  makes a GET call to URI <tt>/text</tt> on the web server you wrote and
		  displays the resulting JSON data. Keep it
		  simple. Produce some tables showing the data.
		  Something that lets you (and me)
		  test quickly whether the data you return makes
		  sense.
		</p>

	      </li>

	      <li>
		<p>
		Create a visualization for the mortality data in a
		file <tt>project4.html</tt>. Here are the parameters I
		want for the visualization:
		<ul>
		  <li>it should give data for 2003, 2008, and 2013;</li>
		  <li>it should contain at least three views that are
		    shown simultaneously on screen;</li>
		  <li>those three views should be synchronized: they
		    should run over the same underlying data, but
		    interacting with a view should 
		    affect the other views (either via switching,
		    filtering, or refining). </li>
		  <li>you can have external filters or selectors that
		  give you more control over the data being
		    visualized.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>There is a fair amount of demographic
		  information in the data set. Dive in and find
		  interesting segments.</p>

		<p>
		  You will want to figure out what data you will need
		  for your visualization, and you will need to extend
		  your server so that it provides that data. Please don't
		  change what the <tt>/test</tt> URI returns. Instead,
		  create a new URI <tt>/data</tt> that returns the
		  data you need for your visualization, and have your
		  visualization use that URI. 
		</p>

		<p>
		  Please provide enough instructions on-screen so I
		  have a sense of what your interactions do (i.e.,
		  don't do what my demoes do!)
		</p>

		<p>As usual, wrap it up in a bow, and try to make
		  it pretty.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions or want more guidance, feel
		free to send me an email.
		</p>


	      </li>

	    </ol>


	    <p>I recommend you create a folder for the project and
	    place all your files in that folder, including the
	    database file you create and the server. It's probably a
	    good idea to place your JavaScript code in its own file as
	    well.</p> 

	    <p>
	      Submission instructions: please email a zipped file with your

	      on a public repo such as GitHub, please feel free to email a link to
	      it instead. Do not include the database file, as it's
	      going to be huge. I can just create my own.</p>
	    
	    <p>Put a README file in your folder that explains how to setup and run
	      your code, if there's anything special I should know.</p>
