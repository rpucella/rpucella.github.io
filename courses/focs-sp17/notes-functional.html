    <h1>Notes on Functional Programming</h1>

    <p>Consider coding the following functions using explicit recursion:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A function <tt>squares : int list -> int list</tt> that squares every element of a list. For example, 
	<tt>squares [1;2;3]</tt> should return <tt>[1; 4; 9]</tt></li>

      <li>A function <tt>diags : 'a list -> ('a * 'a) list</tt> that creates a pair of two same values out of every element of a list. For example, <tt>diags [1;2;3]</tt> should return <tt>[(1,1); (2,2); (3,3)]</tt>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is one way to write those functions:</p>

<pre>
let rec squares xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (x*x)::squares xs'

let rec diags xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (x,x)::diags xs'
</pre>

<p>
It is pretty straightforward to rewrite the previous functions using
an explicit call to a helper function that does the "work" for every 
element of the list.
</p>

<pre>
let square x = x * x

let rec squares xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (square x)::squares xs'


let diag x = (x,x)

let rec diags xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (diag x)::diags xs'
</pre>

<p>
If you examine the rewritten functions, you notice quickly that they all 
share the same structure. In fact, if we replace the recursive function name by
<tt>YYY</tt> and the helper function name by <tt>ZZZ</tt>, they all
have the structure:
</p>
<pre>
let rec YYY xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (ZZZ x) :: YYY xs'
</pre>

    <p>
      A good programming language should give you the ability to
express the common structure of a set of examples using an abstraction
that lets you recover the original examples by instantiating that
abstraction. 
    </p>
    
<p>
    We can write a function that captures the above structure,
and obtain the original functions as special cases of that
    <i>&uuml;ber</i> function. 
</p>

<p>The function is called <tt>map</tt>, and it takes as extra
    argument the <i>function</i> to be applied to every element of the
list.
</p>

<pre>
let rec map f xs =
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x)::(map f xs')
</pre>

<p>To use <tt>map</tt>, you need to pass it a function as a first
argument. Thankfully, we have plenty of functions around, and we can
recover our original functions:
</p>

<pre>
let squares xs = map square xs

let diags xs = map diag xs
</pre>

    <p>(Note: function <tt>map</tt> is available in the OCaml standard library as <tt>List.map</tt>.)</p>

    <p>
      Passing functions around is made possible by the fact that
functions in OCaml (and in many other languages, including JavaScript
      and Python) are just like
any other value: they can be passed around to other functions, they
can be returned from functions, they can be operated on. 
    </p>

    <p>
We have been using functions by giving them names, and passing those
names around. This is fine, but imagine what it would be like if every
time you wanted to use, say, an integer, you had to name it. That is,
if instead of writing <tt>1+2</tt>, you had to write
<pre>
let one = 1 in
let two = 2 in 
  one + two
</pre>
That'd get old fast. You can use integers without naming them. 
It is also possible to use functions without naming then. 
These are called <i>anonymous
  functions</i>, and they are created in OCaml with the syntax:
<pre>
fun x -> <i>expr</i>
</pre>
where <tt><i>expr</i></tt> is an expression representing the body of the function. Thus, for
example, we can rewrite our functions using <tt>map</tt> and
anonymous functions as follows:
    </p>
    
  <pre>
let squares xs = map (fun x -> x * x) xs

let diags xs = map (fun x -> (x,x)) xs
</pre>
  
<p>It tends to make OCaml happier when you wrap anonymous functions in
parentheses, like <tt>(fun x -> x * x)</tt>, because it sometimes
  gets confused trying to figure out where the function body ends.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the function definition notation we have been using, such as:
<pre>
let square x = x * x
</pre>
is just a convenient abbreviation for:
<pre>
let square = (fun x -> x * x)
</pre>
which illustrates that <tt>fun x -> x * x</tt> is a value like any other,
to which we happen to give name <tt>square</tt>. Understanding this, that
functions are just values that can be given a name if we want to, is key to
understanding all that follows. 
</p>


<p>
  As an exercise, consider coding the following functions using <tt>map</tt>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A function <tt>triples : int list -> (int * int * int) list</tt>
    that creates a triple (<i>i</i>,<i>i</i>+1,<i>i</i>+2)$ for every element <i>i</i> in a
  list. For example,  <tt>triples [0; 10; 20]</tt> should return <tt>[(0,1,2); (10,11,12);
    (20,21,22)]</tt></li>

  <li>A function <tt>thirds : ('a * 'b * 'c) list -> 'c list</tt> that extracts the third component of every triple in a list. For example, <tt>thirds [(1,2,3); (4,5,6); (7,8,9)]</tt> should return <tt>[3; 6; 9]</tt>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>
      Here's the simplest way using anonymous functions:
    </p>

<pre>
let triples xs = map (fun x -> (x,x+1,x+2)) xs

let thirds xs = map (fun (a,b,c) -> c) xs
</pre>

<p>Let's ratchet up the difficulty a notch. Consider coding the following
  function using <tt>map</tt>:
</p>


<ul>
<li>A function <tt>distribute : 'a -> 'b list -> ('a * 'b) list</tt> creating tuples with the same given element
as first component from items in a list. For example, <tt>distribute 1 ["a"; "b"; "c"]</tt> should return <tt>[(1,"a");
    (1,"b"); (1,"c")]</tt>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The easiest way is to use an anonymous function:
<pre>
let distribute a xs = map (fun x -> (a,x) xs
</pre>
</p>

<p>
But what if we wanted to give the anonymous function a name, and
define it before using it in <tt>map</tt>? That's the tricky bit. If we
define it locally inside <tt>distribute</tt>, it's still easy:
<pre>
let distribute a xs = 
  let mkPair x = (a,x) in
  map mkPair xs
</pre>
</p>

<p>
But what if, mischievously, we wanted to define the helper function <tt>mkPair</tt>
    <i>outside</i> of <tt>distribute</tt>? Can we do it? Try, go ahead.
</p>

<p>
When you try to write and use such a <tt>mkPair</tt>, you see that it gets
called by <tt>map</tt> with an element of the list. There is no way to tell
<tt>map</tt> to pass <tt>a</tt> as well, unless we change the definition of
<tt>map</tt>, somehow.  
</p>

<p>
But we can do a lot better by remembering that <i>functions are
    values</i> and therefore can be returned from other functions. We use a
function <tt>createMkPair</tt> that takes the <tt>a</tt> and 
creates the appropriate <tt>mkPair</tt> function that works with that
  <tt>a</tt> and that can be passed into <tt>map</tt>: 
</p>

<pre>
let createMkPair a = 
  fun x -> (a,x)

let distribute a xs = map (createMkPair a) xs
</pre>

<p>
Function  <tt>createMkPair</tt> returns a new function, and it is
    <i>that</i> new function that we give as an argument to <tt>map</tt> (via the call <tt>createMkPair
  a</tt>). (Nomenclature trivia: The function returned from <tt>createMkPair</tt>
refers to the <tt>a</tt> that is passed as an argument to
<tt>createMkPair</tt>. In order for this to make sense, the system has to
remember the value for the <tt>a</tt> that was passed in when it returns
the function. Internally, the system does this by associating an environment
with the returned function containing the values for the free
variables in the function. A function and its associated
    environment is usually called a <i>closure</i>.)
</p>

<p>
Note the type of <tt>createMkPair</tt>: it has type <tt>'a -> 'b -> 'a
  * 'b</tt>. So it looks like a function of two arguments. But we've
  approached it as a function that takes one argument and returns a
  new function. Once you learn that <tt>-></tt> associates to the
  right, things become clearer. The type <tt>'a -> 'b -> 'a * 'b</tt>
  is to be understood as <tt>'a -> ('b -> 'a * 'b)</tt>, and this
tells you the whole story: a two-arguments function <tt><i>T<sub>1</sub></i>
    -> <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> -> <i>T<sub>3</sub></i></tt> is really a function that
expects a value of type <tt><i>T<sub>1</sub></i></tt> and returns a
function of type <tt><i>T<sub>2</sub></i>
  -> <i>T<sub>3</sub></i></tt>, that is, a function that expects a
value of   type <tt><i>T<sub>2</sub></i></tt> and returns a value of
type <tt><i>T<sub>3</sub></i></tt>.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the function definition 
<pre>
let add x y = x + y
</pre>
is just an abbreviation for
<pre>
let add x = fun y -> x + y
</pre>
When we call this function, we write
<pre>
add 1 2
</pre>
Application associates to the left, and the above is in fact
equivalent to:
<pre>
(add 1) 2 
</pre>
that is, calling function <tt>add</tt> with argument <tt>1</tt>,
getting back a function of one argument, and then calling that
function with argument <tt>2</tt>. It all works seamlessly.

<p>
That's how we've been working all along. Function 
<tt>add</tt> looks like it's a two argument function, but really,
it's a function returning a function. (More nomenclature trivia: A
  function such as <tt>add</tt>, written in such a way that it looks like a
  multi-argument function but really takes them one after the other in
	a cascade of functions, is called a <i>curried function</i> &mdash; named
  after the logician Haskell Curry.)
</p>

<p>
  Thus,  in our <tt>distribute</tt> example, we can define
<pre>
let createMkPair a x = (a,x)

let distribute a xs = map (createMkPair a) xs
</pre>
</p>

<p>
  The curried notation extends. For instance:
</p>
<pre>
let add x y z = x+y+z
</pre>
is an abbreviation for
<pre>
let add x = fun y -> (fun z -> x+y+z)
</pre>
and of course, it is also equivalent to
<pre>
let add x y = fun z -> x+y+z
</pre>
and in fact if we remember that defining functions in the first place
is an abbreviation, the three definitions above are also equivalent
to:
<pre>
let add = fun x -> (fun y -> (fun z -> x+y+z))
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The curried notation also extends to anonymous functions, so that
<tt>fun x y -> <i>expr</i></tt> is really an abbreviation for <tt>fun x -> (fun y
  -> <i>expr</i>)</tt>, and thus the above definitions for <tt>add</tt> are also
equivalent to:
<pre>
let add = fun x y z -> x+y+z
</pre>
You get the gist.
    </expr>
    
    <p>
      So what's the difference between writing <tt>add</tt> as a curried function
versus having it take a tuple as an argument? Compare:
<pre>
let add (x,y,z) = x+y+z
</pre>
If you try to call <tt>add (1,2)</tt>, you will get a type error:
<pre>
# add (1,2);;
Characters 4-9:
  add (1,2);;
        ^^^^^
Error: This expression has type 'a * 'b
       but an expression was expected of type int * int * int
</pre>
whereas if you define
<pre>
let add x y z = x+y+z
</pre>
and you pass only two arguments to <tt>add</tt>:
<pre>
# add 1 2;;
- : int -> int = <fun>
</pre>
No error at all. You get a function back. Which makes perfect
sense. (What does the function you get back do, though?) This is
called <i>partial application</i>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's finish with an example showing both functions passed as
arguments and returned as results.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      First, define the following curried functions:
<pre>
let add n m = n + m 
let mult n m = n * m
</pre>
Easy enough. Partial application leads to some interesting behavior. For instance, <tt>add 5</tt> gives you back a
function that always adds <tt>5</tt> to its input; <tt>mult 6</tt> gives you
back a function that always multiplies its input by <tt>6</tt>:
<pre>
# let f = add 5;;
val f : int -> int = <fun>
# f 10;;
- : int = 15
# let g = mult 6;;
val g : int -> int = <fun>
# g 10;;
- : int = 60
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can write a functional <i>composition</i> operator that takes two
      functions <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> and composes them together into a single
      function, corresponding to the mathematical operation <i>g &compfn; f</i>.
<pre>
let compose g f = fun x -> g (f x)
</pre>
Function <tt>compose</tt> has type <tt>('b -> 'c) -> ('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'c)</tt>
    </p>

    
    <p>
      Thus, for example, <tt>compose (add 5) (mult 6)</tt> gives you back a
function (what does it do?) and when you apply that function to <tt>3</tt>,
you get back <tt>23</tt>:
<pre>
# let w = compose (add 5) (mult 6);;
val w : int -> int = <fun>
# w 3;;
- : int = 23
# w 10;;
- : int = 65
</pre>
Of course, the definition of <tt>compose</tt> above is equivalent to:
<pre>
let compose g f x = g (f x)
</pre>
    </p>


<h2>Filtering</h2>

    <p>
      Consider coding the following functions:
<ul>
<li>A function <tt>filter : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list</tt> that takes a predicate and a list and returns the list of elements that satisfy the predicate. For example, <tt>filter (fun x -> x>0) [0;1;-2;3;-4;5]</tt> should return <tt>[1;3;5]</tt>
</li>

<li>A function <tt>removeEmpty : 'a list list -> 'a list list</tt> that takes a list of sublists and
  returns the list of all non-empty sublists. For example, <tt>removeEmpty [[1;2]; []; [3]; []]</tt> should return <tt>[[1;2];[3]]</tt> 
</li>
</ul>
    </p>

    
    <p>
Function <tt>filter</tt> is a straightforward recursive function over lists:
<pre>
let rec filter p xs =
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> if (p x) then x :: (filter p xs') 
                else filter p xs'
</pre>
    </p>

<p>    
Function <tt>removeEmpty</tt> can be defined directly as an explicitly recursive
function, but it can also be defined in terms of <tt>filter</tt>:
<pre>
let removeEmpty xss = 
  filter (fun xs -> match xs with [] -> false | _ -> true) xss
</pre>
</p>

    <p>(Note: function <tt>filter</tt> is available in the OCaml standard library as <tt>List.filter</tt>.)</p>

<p>Can we implement <tt>filter</tt> directly using <tt>map</tt>? 
That is, can we define
<pre>
let filter p xs = map ...
</pre>
</p>
?

<p>
There is no way for <tt>map</tt> by itself to be able to express
<tt>filter</tt>, because <tt>map</tt> has the property that the list it returns
has always the same size as the list it is passed as
argument. Function <tt>filter</tt>, on the other hand, can potentially
shrink the size of the list.
</p>

<p>
Now, <tt>map</tt> by itself cannot implement <tt>filter</tt>, but a slight
variant of <tt>map</tt> can:
<pre>
let rec map_append f xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x) @ (map_append f xs')
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Intuitively, while <tt>map f [x;y;z]</tt> returns the list <tt>[f x; f y;
    f z]</tt>, the call <tt>map_append g [x;y;z]</tt> returns the list <tt>[x1; x2; ...;
    xm; y1; y2; ...; yn; z1; z2; ... zp]</tt>, where <tt>g x = [x1; x2;
    ...; xm]</tt>, <tt>g y = [y1; y2; ...; yn]</tt>, and <tt>g z = [z1; z2; ...;
    zp]</tt>. 
</p>


<p>
As an exercise, consider coding the following functions using <tt>map_append</tt>:
<ul>
  <li>A function <tt>flatten : 'a list list -> 'a list</tt> that takes a list of sublists and returns
  a new list with all the sublists' elements in it, in order. For example, <tt>flatten [[1; 2]; [3; 4]; [5]; []; [6; 7]]</tt> should return
<tt>[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7]</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>The function <tt>filter</tt> above.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These functions are directly implemented using <tt>map_append</tt>:
<pre>
let flatten xs = map_append (fun x -> x) xs

let rec filter p xs = 
  map_append (fun x -> if (p x) then [x] else []) xs
</pre>
Note that <tt>flatten</tt> uses the identity function <tt>fun x -> x</tt> as the
transformation.
</p>

<p>
(That <tt>flatten</tt> is <tt>map_append</tt> with an identity function as
transformation suggests that there is a special relationship between
<tt>map_append</tt> and <tt>flatten</tt>. Indeed, if instead of defining
<tt>map_append</tt>, we had defined <tt>flatten</tt> directly, we could derive
<tt>let map_append f xs = flatten (map f xs)</tt>)
</p>

<p>
Functions <tt>map</tt> and <tt>map_append</tt> have a lot in common. Can we make
precise what they have in common and write a single function that can
do whatever <tt>map</tt> and <tt>map_append</tt> can do?
</p>

<p>
Here is the code for <tt>map</tt> and <tt>map_append</tt>, next to each other:
<pre>
let rec map f xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x) :: (map f xs')

let rec map_append f xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x) @ (map_append f xs')
</pre>
</p>

    <p>
We see they both have the structure:
<pre>
let rec MMM f xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> (f x) XXX (MMM f xs')
</pre>
where <tt>XXX</tt> is the combination function, <tt>::</tt> for <tt>map</tt>, and
<tt>@</tt> for <tt>map_append</tt>. We can replace that <tt>XXX</tt> by a function
that is passed as an argument, and we obtain <tt>map_general_1</tt>:
<pre>
let rec map_general_1 comb f xs = 
  match xs with 
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> comb (f x) (map_general_1 comb f xs')
</pre>
and we can now write, as desired:
<pre>
let map f xs = map_general_1 (fun x ys -> x :: ys) f xs

let map_append f xs = map_general_1 (fun x ys -> x @ ys) f xs
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
In fact, passing in both <tt>comb</tt> and <tt>f</tt> as arguments to <tt>map_general_1</tt>
is unnecessary: a suitable combination function can play the role of
both <tt>comb</tt> and <tt>f</tt>:
<pre>
let rec map_general comb xs = 
  match xs with 
    [] -> []
  | x :: xs' -> comb x (map_general comb xs')
</pre>
and to see that we have not lost any generality, we can implement the
original <tt>map_general_1</tt> using <tt>map_general</tt>:
<pre>
let map_general_1 comb f xs = 
  map_general (fun x ys -> comb (f x) ys) xs
</pre>
    </p>


    <h2>Folding</h2>

    <p>
Can we go even more general? If you look carefully at <tt>map_general</tt>,
or feed it to OCaml, you see it has type
<pre>
('a -> 'b list -> 'b list) -> 'a list -> 'b list
</pre>
In particular, the result of calling <tt>map_general</tt> is always a
list.
    </p>

    <p>
Now, there are functions on lists that do not return lists, but still
have a lot in common with <tt>map_general</tt>. For instance, <tt>sum</tt>, with its
obvious recursive definition:
<pre>
let add m n = m + n

let rec sum xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> 0
  | x :: xs' -> add x (sum xs')
</pre>
where I use <tt>add</tt> in <tt>sum</tt> to emphasize the commonality with
<tt>map_general</tt>. 
    </p>

    <p>
Look at the code for <tt>map_general</tt> and <tt>sum</tt> next to each other. One
difference is that <tt>sum</tt> embeds its combination function <tt>add</tt>
directly in the code, which is fine. We can imagine pulling it out as
an argument:
<pre>
let rec sum_general comb xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> 0
  | x :: xs' -> comb x (sum_general comb xs')
</pre>
Now, the code for <tt>map_general</tt> and <tt>sum_general</tt> are very similar, and share
the following structure:
<pre>
let rec FFF comb xs = 
  match xs with
    [] -> YYY
  | x :: xs' -> comb x (FFF comb xs')
</pre>
where <tt>YYY</tt> is the difference between the functions, namely the
value returned by the function on an empty list. So we can do as
we did for <tt>map_general</tt>, and simply make that difference a parameter to
the function. We get the following function, with one of its common names:
<pre>
let rec fold_right comb xs base = 
  match xs with
    [] -> base
  | x :: xs' -> comb x (fold_right comb xs' base)
</pre>
(That function is also sometimes called <tt>reduce</tt>.)
After a moment's thought, we see that:
<pre>
let map_general comb xs = fold_right comb xs [] 

let sum xs = fold_right add xs 0 
</pre>
Function <tt>fold_right</tt> is very interesting. It really does nothing
except recurse. Everything else is delegated to the functions given
  as arguments. It is the <i>essence</i> of
structural recursion on lists. Most recursive functions on lists, as
long as they recurse on the tail of the list, can be implemented in
term of <tt>fold_right</tt> for the appropriate combination function and
base value.
    </p>

    <p>(Note: function <tt>fold_right</tt> is available in the OCaml standard library as <tt>List.fold_right</tt>.)</p>

    <p>As an exercise, Consider coding the following functions using <tt>fold_right</tt>:
<ul>
<li>The function <tt>removeEmpty : 'a list list -> 'a list list</tt> we saw earlier.
</li>

<li>A function <tt>heads : 'a list list -> 'a list</tt> that takes a list of sublists 
  and return the first element of each sublist, skipping over empty lists. For example, <tt>heads [[1;2];[];[3]]</tt> should return <tt>[1;3]</tt>.
</li>

<li>A function <tt>concat : string list -> string</tt> that takes a list of strings and returns
  the result of concatenating all the strings together in the order in
  which they appear in the list. For example, <tt>concat ["goodbye ","cruel ";"world"]</tt> should return 
<tt>"goodbye cruel world"</tt>.
</li>
</ul>
    </p>

    
    <p>
At first, the trick is to first write down the function using
explicit recursion, and then read off the appropriate combination
function and base value. With practice, you can then come up with them
directly:
<pre>
let removeEmpty xs =
