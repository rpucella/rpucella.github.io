	    The rest of <a disabled_href="./homework4.html">Homework 4</a> has been posted. Note that I've made some small changes to <tt>homework4.ml</tt> pertaining to questions 2 to 4, so if you already have solutions to question 1 (which I hope you have!) I will ask you to transfer your answers to the new file. It'll make everything easier. I apologize about the minor complexities this causes.

	    The first question of <a disabled_href="./homework4.html">Homework 4</a> is out, covering the material I sent over the weekend for the class we missed on Thursday. The remaining questions will go out Friday covering the class material on Thursday. Due Friday February 24th.

	    The snow day last Thursday put a bit of a wrinkle of my
	    plans. Rather than try to make it up later in the
	    semester, I've <a href="./notes-functional.html">posted the notes in narrative form</a>, and I
	    will let you read through them. Thankfully, that class
	    was a bit of a parenthesis, since I did not
	    want to introduce two machines models in two consecutive
	    lectures. So have a read, and let us know if you have any
	    questions. Rest assured our Ninjas know this stuff down
	    cold. <br><br>
	     I will fold part of what
	  would have been the homework this week into the next, which
	  will go out a bit earlier. More specifically: on Monday, two
	  questions of homework 4 will go out, and the rest of
	  homework 4 will come out end of the week. It will be due the
	  following Friday 2/24.
