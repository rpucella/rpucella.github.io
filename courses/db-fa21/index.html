      <h1>Databases (Fall 2021)</h1>

      <p>This is an introduction to database systems. Topics covered
        include: the relational model, SQL-based querying,
        transactions, data structures, as well non-relational database
        models. The approach will be hands-on: while we will practice
        on existing database systems, we will also write code to
        implement simplified versions of the various database models
        and their query systems.
      </p>

          <li><b>Programming:</b> All programming in the course will be done in
            <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a>. I will assume working knowledge of the
	    language. We will largely follow
	    the <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8
	      style guide</a>, and you
            may also want to read through <a href="https://www.memonic.com/user/pneff/folder/python/id/1bufp">this</a> as well.</li>

          <li><b>Grading:</b> The final grade is based on biweekly homeworks (60%)
            and a final project (40%). All homeworks except the first is to
            be done in teams of two. Late homeworks will be penalized (10%
            per 24 hours) and no homework will be accepted after its
	    solution has been discussed in class. <b>Please do not post your homework code on a publicly available
	      repository like GitHub.</b> I hate to do this kind of policing,
	    but we've had some issues in the past, and I'd like to avoid a
	    repeat if possible. It is okay to post your final project on
	    a publicly available repo.</li>

          <li>I expect all of us to follow the <b><a href="http://www.olin.edu/academic-life/student-affairs-resources/student-life/honor-code/">Olin Honor Code</a></b>.</li>

              <p>The <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf">original paper</a> of Codd on the relational model, which is of historic interest. Also interesting is Codd's <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358396.358400">1981 Turing Award lecture</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> is a small relational database engine that stores data in a single file and can be accessed programmatically from many programming languages. It's useful in its own right, but it's great for learning about the basics of relational data. It is also generally installed by default on Linux and Mac OS X installations.

	      <p>There are tons of tutorials on SQL online, usually tied to a particular database implementation, since you can't use SQL "in the abstract". I've used <a href="http://www.postgresqltutorial.com">Postgres's SQL tutorial</a> in the past to introduce SQL to colleagues (start with Section 2). An interactive tutorial that I greatly enjoy is <a href="https://sqlbolt.com/">SQLBolt</a>.</p>

              <p>The sample <a href="./sqlite.txt">SQLite</a> interactions I demoed in class.</p>

              <p>Two SQL features we did not cover in class but you may run into are <a href="https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-views/">views</a> (which are a form of live query that looks like a table in the database) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure">stored procedures</a> (which are a form of functions that can be written directly into the database). Views tend to look the same across relational databases, while stored procedures are much more vendor dependent.</p>

              <p>A reasonable set of slides on <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4320/2008fa/slides/20081114_fds.pdf">normalizations and functional dependencies</a>. It goes into a bit more details about decomposition, including the notion of lossless-ness.</p>

              <p>Overviews of physical storage and indexing tend to be hefty because there are many axes across which to compare the various approaches.

	      <p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html">JDBC</a> is the Java API for connecting to databases. Most databases have JDBC drivers that support that API. It has become a de facto standard, and many other languages use that same API to provide database connectivity.</p>
	      
	      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORMs</a> (Object-Relational Mappings) are a more abstract  way to provide an interface to a database through a programming language: ORMs reify database tables as data structures in the language, so that modifying the structures will automatically update the underlying tables, and changes to the underlying tables will be visible through the structures.</p>

	      <p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/">LINQ</a> is one approach to integrate SQL-style querying within a programming language (here, C#).</p>

	      <p>Object persistence is the idea that we can create objects in a programming language and have those objects automatically be made persistent by transparently storing them in a database. Java does not do this automatically, but <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-serialization">serialization</a> is the main mechanism to achieve persistence. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JADE_(programming_language)">JADE</a> is an example of a programming language that supports object persistence natively and transparently.</p>

	      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory">Transactional memory</a> is an approach to programming concurrent systems in a way that does not require locks, by essentially moving the notion of transactions to the world of reading and writing memory within a single machine.</p>

	      <p>Lamport's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos protocol</a> (well, protocol family) is one of the most common ways to achieve consensus on what the data stored in a distributed system is when some of the nodes disagree due to update messages not getting to them. It is worth understanding. Here is a two-parter that does a reasonable job explaining the details: <a href="https://distributedthoughts.com/2013/09/22/understanding-paxos-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://distributedthoughts.com/2013/09/30/understanding-paxos-part-2/">Part 2</a>.

              <p>Old lecture slides from Stanford describing typical <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/06-basic-graph-algorithms.pdf">graph representations and algorithms</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> is the prototypical graph database.

Its source code is <a href="https://github.com/twitter-archive/flockdb">available</a>. (Interestingly, it is written in <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>.)</p>

              <p>TAO is used at Facebook (at least as of a few years ago) to store and serve the social graph. A <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc13/atc13-bronson.pdf">technical paper</a> describing TAO appears in the Usenix 2013 Technical Conference.</p>

              <p>Although the name suggests it is a graph-based query language, <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is not related to graph databases. It is, quoting from the working draft of the specification, <i>"a query language and execution engine originally created at Facebook in 2012 for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models for client-server applications"</i>. Still worth knowing though, since it's becoming increasing popular as an API query language.</p>
